# Product Design Agent: Setup in Google Gemini
Complete installation guide for setting up the Product Design Agent in Google Gemini using Gems.

## Prerequisites

**Required:** [Google One AI Premium subscription](https://one.google.com/about/plans) to access Gemini Advanced and Gems feature.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Access Gemini Gems
1. **Log into Gemini** at [gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com)
2. **Navigate to Gems**: 
   - Look for "Gems" in the left sidebar, or
   - Click the gem icon (ðŸ’Ž) in the interface, or
   - Go directly to [gemini.google.com/gems](https://gemini.google.com/gems)

### Step 2: Create Your Design Agent Gem
1. **Click "New Gem"** or the "+" button
2. **Name your gem**: "Product Design Agent" or "Design Mentor Assistant"
3. **Add a description**: "AI-powered design mentorship with specialized agents for UX/UI, research, strategy, and leadership guidance"

### Step 3: Upload Project Knowledge
1. **In the gem creation interface**, look for the "Knowledge" or "Files" section
2. **Upload repository files**:
   - Download the repository as ZIP from GitHub
   - Extract and upload the `config/`, `knowledge/`, and `assets/` folders
   - Upload the `README.md` file
3. **Alternative method**:
   - Upload files individually through the file picker
   - Focus on essential directories: `config`, `knowledge`, `assets`

### Step 4: Configure Gem Instructions
1. **Locate the instructions file**: In the uploaded files, find `assets/instructions.md`
2. **Copy the contents** of that file
3. **Set up Custom Instructions**: Look for "Instructions" in your project settings
4. **Paste the instructions** from the instructions.md file
5. **Save the configuration**

2. **Paste the complete contents** from `assets/instructions.md` in the repository
3. **Adjust the instructions** to reference uploaded files properly for Gemini's context

### Step 5: Set Conversation Starters
Add these conversation starters to help users get started:

- "What can you help me with as a design mentor?"
- "I'm new to this agent - show me the capabilities"
- "Help me with user research for my project"
- "I need guidance on design strategy"
- "Can you review my design process?"

### Step 6: Configure Gem Settings
1. **Set the persona**: Professional, expert design mentor
2. **Choose conversation style**: Helpful, structured, actionable
3. **Set response length**: Comprehensive (to provide detailed guidance)
4. **Language settings**: Enable multilingual support (EN/ES)

### Step 7: Add User Preferences (Optional)
1. **Create a user preferences document** with your specific needs:
   - Response detail level (minimal/standard/comprehensive)
   - Primary language preference
   - Focus areas (research/strategy/execution/validation)
   - Output format preferences
2. **Upload as additional context** to the gem
3. **Reference in instructions** for personalized responses

### Step 8: Test Your Gem
1. **Save and create** the gem
2. **Start a new conversation** with your gem
3. **Test with sample queries**:
   - "What design methodology should I use for user research?"
   - "Help me create a usability testing plan"
   - "I need a design system strategy"

## Important Differences from Claude

### File Management
- **Gemini**: Upload files directly to gem creation interface
- **Context Limits**: Be mindful of Gemini's context window with large uploads
- **File References**: Files are automatically available in conversation context

### Instruction Format
- **Gemini**: Uses a single instruction field rather than separate project instructions
- **Context Integration**: Files and instructions are merged automatically
- **Response Style**: Adapt instructions for Gemini's conversation patterns

### Conversation Management
- **Gems**: Each gem maintains its specialized context across conversations
- **Memory**: Gemini gems remember context within conversation threads
- **Switching**: Easy to switch between different gems for different needs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**File Upload Problems**
- Try uploading smaller file batches if bulk upload fails
- Ensure files are in supported formats (.md, .yaml, .csv, .txt)
- Check file size limits for your subscription level

**Instructions Too Long**
- Break instructions into multiple sections if needed
- Focus on core functionality in main instructions
- Use uploaded files for detailed methodology references

**Limited Knowledge Access**
- Verify all key files were uploaded successfully
- Check that file references in instructions match uploaded file names
- Try re-uploading critical configuration files

### Optimization Tips

**Better Context Usage**
- Organize uploaded files with clear naming conventions
- Create a master index file that references all other materials
- Use consistent terminology across all uploaded content

**Enhanced Performance**
- Start conversations with specific design challenges
- Reference uploaded materials explicitly in your queries
- Build conversation context gradually for complex projects

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Project Support
- Create separate gems for different project types
- Use descriptive names: "B2B Design Agent", "Mobile UX Agent", etc.
- Share gems with team members for collaborative design guidance

### Integration Workflows
- **With Google Workspace**: Reference Drive files and Docs directly
- **With Design Tools**: Upload exported files from Figma, Sketch, etc.
- **With Research Data**: Upload user research findings and analytics

## Next Steps
Once your gem is active:
- **Explore Task Categories**: Ask "What design tasks can you help with?"
- **Upload Project Context**: Add your specific project files for tailored guidance
- **Request Specialized Help**: Ask for specific agent expertise (Research, Strategy, etc.)
- **Use Bilingual Features**: Switch between English and Spanish naturally
