# Product Initiative Canvas Playbook

> **Executive Summary** — The Initiative Canvas aligns the team around a clear, shared understanding of a product initiative by outlining its purpose, target audience, expected outcomes, and key constraints. It acts as a strategic starting point to ensure focus, drive alignment, and guide early decision-making before moving into execution.

## Overview & Objectives
- **Purpose:** Provide a structured, one-page approach to define the business problem, outcomes, segments, problems, competitive context, solution ideas, value proposition, success metrics, costs/resources/constraints/risks, and scope & timeline.
- **Scope:** Use this guide to plan and capture all Initiative Canvas sections end-to-end, from problem framing through delivery boundaries and milestones.
- **Audience:** Product managers, designers, engineers, data/analytics, marketing, and executive stakeholders.
- **Success Criteria:** Canvas is complete, internally consistent, aligned to product/OKRs, and includes measurable KPIs, explicit constraints/risks, and a clear scope & timeline.

## Preparation

### 9) Costs, Resources, Constraints & Risks
- **Company (Constructor) stakeholders:** Who will play a role.

- **Execution timeline:** Realistic schedule with milestones, deadlines, dependencies for timely delivery and success.

### 11) Wrap-Up
- Confirm alignment to strategy and outcomes.
- Assign owners, due dates, and decision records.
- Capture assumptions and open questions for follow-up.

  - Use existing research/analytics and current journey maps to ground decisions.
  - Write testable, single-feature hypotheses.
  - Make KPIs measurable with explicit targets and timelines.
  - Document constraints/risks early; reflect them in scope & plan.
- **Avoid**
  - Vague segments or conflating customers (DMs) with end users.
  - Bundling multiple features into one hypothesis.
  - Overbroad scope without out-of-scope items.
  - Timelines without dependencies and milestone owners.

## Tools & Resources
- **Analytics & research:** Existing findings and analytics data (e.g., product analytics platforms).
- **Journey & process mapping:** Current customer journey/process maps and walkthroughs.
- **Competitive analysis:** Summaries/grids of competitor strengths, weaknesses, positioning.
- **Planning:** Milestone calendar, stakeholder roster, risk register.

## FAQ / Quick Answers
- **Q:** What’s the difference between Customer and User here?  
  **A:** Customers are decision makers/buyers; Users are the roles who interact with and use the product.
- **Q:** How should we phrase feature hypotheses?  
  **A:** Use: *We believe that [business outcome] will be achieved if [user] attains [benefit] with [feature].*
