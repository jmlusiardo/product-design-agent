## Preparation (Before the Conversation)

### Strategic Planning Checklist
- [ ] **Identify conversation type**: Breaking bad news vs. difficult conversation vs. disagreement
- [ ] **Write your argument ahead of time** with supporting data
- [ ] **Research the other person**: Background, priorities, communication style
- [ ] **Prepare multiple solutions** not just problems
- [ ] **Set enough time** (90 minutes for complex discussions)
- [ ] **Choose private location** ensuring confidentiality
- [ ] **Identify the crux**: What's the real disagreement?
- [ ] **Plan your elevator pitch** if advocating for something

### Mental & Emotional Preparation
- [ ] Acknowledge you may be wrong
- [ ] Be willing to change your mind
- [ ] Separate emotions from arguments
- [ ] Prepare to steelman (not strawman) their position
- [ ] Remember: Most people don't want to be difficult, but to do things right
- [ ] Consider their perspective and motivations

### Setting the Stage
- **Give advance notice** for sensitive topics
- **Ask for consent** before discussing difficult matters
- **Explain meeting purpose** upfront
- **State desired outcomes** clearly
- **Create psychological safety** by normalizing questions

## Main Conversation Flow

### Phase 1: Opening (10-15 minutes)

#### Establish Context
- **Check awareness**: "What do you know about [topic]?"
- **Gauge perception**: "How do you feel about the situation?"
- **Listen for**: Tone, avoided terms, body language
- **Find common ground**: What you both agree on

#### The Warning Shot (For Bad News)
- "I need to discuss something difficult today"
- "I'm afraid I have some bad news"
- **Pause** - Let them mentally prepare
- Ask: "How much would you like to know?"

#### For Disagreements
- Start with shared goals and values
- Acknowledge: "We agree on 95% - let's focus on the 5%"
- Frame as collaboration: "How can we find the best solution together?"

### Phase 2: Information Exchange (30-45 minutes)

#### Presenting Your Position
- **Use small chunks** of information
- **Avoid jargon** - use their language
- **Assign probabilities**: "I'm 70% confident that..."
- **Check understanding**: "Am I making sense?"
- **Repeat key points** for retention

#### Active Listening Techniques
- **Echo their points**: "So you're saying..."
- **Listen for buried questions**
- **Note terms used or avoided**
- **Ask clarifying questions** before challenging
- **Assume good intentions**

#### Constructive Argumentation
- **Find the central crux** of disagreement
- **Steelman their argument** - make it strongest
- **Use double cruxing**: "What would change your mind?"
- **Spot logical fallacies** but address respectfully
- **Focus on evidence over emotion**

### Phase 3: Working Through Emotions (15-20 minutes)

#### Acknowledge Feelings
- "I understand this is upsetting"
- "What are you thinking/feeling?"
- "Take your time to process this"
- Allow **up to 7 seconds of silence**

#### Avoid These Traps
- ðŸš« Giving false hope to comfort
- ðŸš« Getting defensive when challenged
- ðŸš« Dismissing or ignoring emotions
- ðŸš« Rushing to solutions too quickly

#### Do These Instead
- âœ… Respond empathetically
- âœ… Validate their perspective
- âœ… Share your own uncertainties
- âœ… Leave them a line of retreat

### Phase 4: Resolution & Next Steps (15-20 minutes)

#### Finding Solutions
- **Most decisions are reversible** - emphasize this
- **Problems have infinite solutions** - explore options
- **Consider both/and** instead of either/or
- **Know when to disagree and commit**
- **Sometimes "losing" beats bad compromise**

#### Closing Strong
- Summarize key discussion points
- Clarify decisions and owners
- Outline concrete next steps
- Schedule follow-up if needed
- Offer ongoing support

## Specialized Conversation Types

### Breaking Bad News Framework

#### The 7-Step Process
1. **Prepare thoroughly** - Know your facts, set time/place
2. **Check their awareness** - "What do you know about...?"
3. **Give warning shot** - "I have difficult news"
4. **Ask information preference** - "How much detail?"
5. **Deliver with empathy** - Clear, simple language
6. **Acknowledge emotions** - Allow processing time
7. **Strategy & summary** - Next steps and support

#### Key Principles
- Never surprise with bad news
- Use straightforward language
- Allow silence for processing
- Don't give false hope
- Provide clear next steps

### Advocacy Conversations (e.g., for Inclusion)

#### Preparation
- Have concise elevator pitch ready
- Focus on both positive impact AND negative harm
- Prepare actionable alternatives
- Connect to business value/legal risk

#### Response Templates

**"We don't have time for that":**
- "Investing now prevents expensive fixes later"
- "Let's revisit the timeline together"
- "This aligns with our core values"

**"That's just an edge case":**
- "Even 1% can be hundreds of users"
- "Exclusion can be a complete blocker"
- "Customers buy for ALL their workers"

**"We'll do it later":**
- "Retrofitting costs 100x more"
- "Sometimes it's impossible to add later"
- "Let's build it right from the start"

### Managing Difficult Coworkers

#### Strategy
1. **Frame around shared goals** not positions
2. **When emotions are high**, evidence rarely wins
3. **Understand their motivations** and fears
4. **Pick battles carefully** - stand firm vs. let go
5. **Always leave a graceful exit**

## Argumentation Techniques

### The Pyramid of Debate Quality

#### Avoid (Bottom Tier)
- **Social shaming**: Ad hominem attacks
- **Gotchas**: Catchy but fallacious soundbites
- **Single facts**: Cherry-picked data

#### Pursue (Top Tier)
- **Good faith evidence surveys**: Multiple studies reviewed
- **Operationalizing**: Clear, testable claims
- **High-level value discussions**: Acknowledging different principles

### Key Techniques

#### Steelmanning
1. Listen to their argument completely
2. List all interpretations (best to worst)
3. Select strongest version
4. Strengthen it further if needed
5. Confirm: "Is this what you mean?"

#### Double Cruxing
- Person A: "I believe X"
- Person B: "I believe Y"
- A would change mind if: [Falsifiable fact]
- B would change mind if: [Falsifiable fact]
- Find the real crux of disagreement

#### Logical Fallacy Recognition
- **Strawman**: Misrepresenting to attack
- **Slippery slope**: Hypothetical extremes
- **Ad hominem**: Attacking person not argument
- **Cherry-picking**: Selective data
- **False dilemma**: Only two options presented

## Best Practices & Principles

### DO
- âœ… **Most people want to do right** - assume good intent
- âœ… **Disagreement â‰  conflict** - it's opportunity
- âœ… **Strong data beats strong words**
- âœ… **Invite participation by seniority** (CEO last)
- âœ… **Document decisions and rationale**
- âœ… **Check in with yourself** emotionally after

### DON'T
- ðŸš« **Let loudest voice dominate**
- ðŸš« **Hide opinions or sandwich feedback**
- ðŸš« **Catch people unprepared**
- ðŸš« **Assume hostility** - may be perspective
- ðŸš« **Negotiate during emotional peaks**
- ðŸš« **Focus on "winning"** over understanding
