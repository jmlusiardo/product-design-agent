# Assisting Design Leads on Onboarding Design Leads

> **Executive Summary** — This guide equips heads of design and senior leaders to onboard new **Design Leads**. It translates two source documents into a 90‑day plan with clear checklists, rhythms, deliverables, and culture practices. Emphasis: align design with business goals, build cross‑functional coalitions, institute research/validation habits, and nurture team growth—while funding and empowering UX at the right level.

## Overview & Objectives
- **Purpose:** Help existing leaders systematically onboard incoming Design Leads to translate strategy into design outcomes and set teams up for success.
- **Scope:** First 90 days plus ongoing practices—stakeholder mapping, communication rhythms, success metrics, design principles, team development, research/validation culture, and funding/governance.
- **Audience:** Heads/Directors of Design, Managers-of-Managers, Design Ops.
- **Success Criteria / KPIs:**
  - User satisfaction on key experiences.
  - Time‑to‑market for design deliverables.
  - Team growth and development progress.
  - Strength of cross‑functional partnerships (PM/Eng/CS).
  - Evidence of outside‑in behaviors (e.g., regular usability testing, field studies, stakeholder advocacy).
  - Retention and engagement of designers.

## Preparation (Before Day 1)
- **Research & Planning:**
  - Clarify how the lead’s area ladders to company goals (OKRs, timelines, outcomes).
  - Define the initial stakeholder set: Product Managers, Engineering Leads, Customer Success/Sales partners, adjacent Design Leads/Senior Designers.
  - Decide reporting/decision cadence: weekly team syncs, bi‑weekly stakeholder updates, monthly design reviews.
  - Draft starter success metrics and a lightweight set of design principles.
- **Checklist**
  - - [ ] Role expectations documented (strategy translation, resource planning, risk management, team development).
  - - [ ] Stakeholder roster + intros scheduled (first 2 weeks).
  - - [ ] Meeting rhythms pre‑booked (team/stakeholders/reviews).
  - - [ ] Seed metrics selected (user satisfaction, delivery speed, team development).
  - - [ ] Research access prepared (users, analytics, field visits, usability testing).
  - - [ ] Budget guardrail communicated (allocate **12–15%** of development budget to UX per project).
  - - [ ] Governance touchpoint defined (UX/CX panel or Listening Council sponsorship).

## Organization Type & Culture: Outside‑In Behaviors to Embed
> Use these culture practices to assess and shape the environment your new lead inherits.

- **1. Gather evidence and data**
  - Manager action: Build a pipeline of user‑behavior data (usability research preferred). Stand up a research team or outsource.

- **2. Validate with users**
  - Manager action: Require validation of concepts against user goals, tasks, habits, expectations; trace ideas to tangible “day‑in‑the‑life” insights.

- **3. Test UI assumptions**
  - Manager action: Make usability testing “clockwork”; integrate with Agile/Lean sprint/backlog planning.

- **4. Think like your users**
  - Manager action: Ensure teams regularly access real users—even hard‑to‑reach segments; leverage UX pros to guarantee successful interactions.

- **5. Factor user needs at key decision points**
  - Manager action: Use field studies, journey maps, personas to inject user needs “just in time”; position UX as advocacy for the bottom line.

- **6. Reference user habits, behavior, and needs**
  - Manager action: In reviews, ask “What’s the user’s task?” “What problem are they solving?” and “What’s the probability the user will do this?”

- **7. Empathize with pain points**
  - Manager action: Provide time for user visits, videos, photo reviews; support Design Thinking training where empathy is core.

- **8. Research like a boss**
  - Manager action: Establish ongoing **user research** as cost of doing business; balance usability testing with in‑the‑field visits (qual explains the “why/how”).

- **9. Spread the obsession organization‑wide**
  - Manager action: Cultivate developers as grassroots advocates, PMs as partners, and executives as sponsors—alignment at all levels.

- **10. Revolutionize product management with UX**
  - Manager action: Require PM partnership with human/user‑centered design; measure and bake UX results into product management.

- **11. Fund and empower UX**
  - Manager action: Allocate **12–15%** of development budget per project to UX; provide its own mandate (like SEO/Accessibility).

- **12. Give UX senior management (ear to the CEO)**
  - Manager action: Stand up a **Listening Council / UX‑CX panel** to set strategy, direct customer innovation, manage metrics, and build UX culture.

## Aftermath / Follow‑ups (Beyond 90 Days)
- **Embrace the glue‑work:** Planning, coordinating, and communicating *is* the leadership job.
- **Stay connected to craft:** Reserve time to review work; occasionally tackle small, strategic design challenges.
- **Measure what matters:** Track team satisfaction/retention; monitor health of PM/Eng partnerships; link design decisions to business metrics; maintain a portfolio of impact stories.
- **Sustain culture:** Keep usability testing regular; maintain field research; continue stakeholder advocacy and executive alignment.

## Best Practices & Pitfalls
- **Do:**
  - Translate strategy into design outcomes early.
  - Set and honor cadences (team/stakeholder/review).
  - Publish principles; scale via frameworks, not heroics.
  - Invest in research and empathy; validate with real users.
  - Fund UX adequately; provide governance with access to leadership.
- **Avoid:**
  - “War‑room” debates without user evidence.
  - Micromanaging individual pixels; lead via systems and storytelling.
  - Treating UX as neutral—acknowledge its advocacy for users and outcomes.
  - Relying only on quantitative data—balance with qualitative insight.

## Tools & Resources
- User research program (field studies + usability testing).
- Metrics dashboard for user satisfaction, delivery speed, team development.
- Design review & decision log templates.
- Stakeholder update templates and review calendar.
- UX/CX panel charter and meeting cadence.
