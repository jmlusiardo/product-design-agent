# Complete Guide to Kickoff Meetings

## Overview
A Kickoff Meeting is typically the first meeting between a new client and a vendor. It serves as the foundation for successful project collaboration and sets the tone for the entire engagement.

### Primary Objectives
1. **Determine Fit**: Assess whether the client and vendor are a good match for each other
2. **Identify Scope**: Define the project boundaries, requirements, and expectations
3. **Frame the Challenge**: Properly scope the design challenge to drive toward impact

**Important**: Not everyone is a good fit for each other. It's better to turn down a bad fit opportunity before it begins.

## Pre-Meeting Preparation

### Research & Planning
- **Research the client**: Gather background information about their business, industry, culture, and history
- **Prepare custom questions**: Develop specific questions based on your research
- **Set expectations**: Explain meeting objectives to all attendees beforehand if possible

- **Allocate time**: Plan for approximately 90 minutes

## Framing the Design Challenge

### Key Principles for Proper Framing

1. **Create a Clear Challenge Statement**
   - Single sentence that conveys what you want to do
   - Often phrased as a question to be solution-oriented
   - Should be memorable and easy to communicate

2. **Ensure Your Challenge:**
   - **Drives toward ultimate impact**: Focus on meaningful outcomes
   - **Allows for variety of solutions**: Not too prescriptive
   - **Takes into account constraints and context**: Realistic and achievable

3. **Avoid Common Pitfalls:**
   - **Too Narrow**: Won't offer enough room for creative solutions
   - **Too Broad**: Won't give you any idea where to start
   - Test: Can you come up with 5 possible solutions in a few minutes?

4. **Iterate and Refine**
   - Run your challenge through these filters multiple times
   - The right question is key to arriving at a good solution
   - Keep refining until you're excited to tackle it

## Additional Frameworks

### UX Writing Kickoff Framework (WHAT-WHY-HOW-WHERE-WHO-WHEN)
When the project involves content or UX writing, address:
- **WHAT**: What problem needs to be solved?
- **WHY**: What is the objective?
- **HOW**: How will we accomplish this objective?
- **WHERE**: Where will the content/design have impact?
- **WHO**: Who are the users?
- **WHEN**: When will this be published/launched?

### Stakeholder Interview Framework
For deeper stakeholder understanding:
- **Why redesign now?**
- **Where can we go wrong?**
- **What is the timeline for this initiative?**
- Use this to define redesign scope based on:
  - Look and Feel (remain same/minor improvements/major refresh)
  - Functionality (remain same/minor adjustments/major refresh)
  - Target audience (remain same/minor adjustments/completely different)

## Conclusion
