# Heuristic Evaluation Playbook: Plan, Run, and Synthesize (NN/g-Based)

> **Executive Summary** — A step-by-step kit to plan and conduct NN/g-style heuristic evaluations, capture findings using the workbook or spreadsheet template, and synthesize results into prioritized actions. Grounded in Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics and NN/g’s recommended workflow.

## Overview

- **Purpose:** Identify likely UX/usability problems by judging an interface against established heuristics.  
- **Scope:** Works across UIs (prototypes, physical products, games, VR, voice, etc.); especially useful early in design.  
- **Audience:** Product designers, UX researchers, engineers, and PMs running expert reviews.  
- **Outcomes:**  
  - Consolidated list of issues mapped to heuristics with recommendations.  
  - Synthesis (affinity clustering), prioritization, and test targets for upcoming usability studies.  
- **Caveat:** Heuristic evaluations **complement** but don’t replace user research; context determines whether a violation is truly a problem.  

## Preparation

### Choose Heuristics
- Default to **Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics**; add domain-specific heuristics as needed.

### Build & Train the Team
- **Team size:** 3–5 independent evaluators reviewing the **same** interface.  
- **Primer:** Have all evaluators read/understand the heuristics; do a quick practice round together (e.g., a weather app).

### Decide How to Document
- **Workbook (interactive PDF):** One page per heuristic with **Issues** and **Recommendations** fields.  
- **Spreadsheet:** Capture **one observation per row** with its corresponding heuristic.  
- **Digital whiteboard (Miro/Mural):** Separate workspace per evaluator; place sticky notes on screenshots; keep notes **independent** until all finish.

### Define Scope (keep it narrow)
- Start with a **manageable scope**: one task, one section, one user group, or one device type.

### Optional: Task Analysis
- List main tasks/sub-tasks → have product team rank importance → resolve questions.

### Prep Checklist
- - [ ] Confirm heuristic set (NN/g 10 by default).  
- - [ ] Recruit **3–5** evaluators; share heuristics primer.  
- - [ ] Choose capture method (Workbook / Spreadsheet / Whiteboard).  
- - [ ] Set a **narrow scope** (task/section/user group/device).  
- - [ ] (Optional) Run a quick practice evaluation.  

## Main Flow / Process

### 1) Kickoff & Orientation
- Reiterate scope, user group(s), device, and task.  
- Clarify capture tools and independence rule (don’t view others’ notes yet).  

### 2) Independent Evaluation (~1–2 hours per evaluator)
- **Pass 1 — Familiarize:** Walk through the task end-to-end without judging.  
- **Pass 2 — Inspect:** Re-walk the task and log elements that **violate a heuristic**; record issue + recommendation.  

### 3) Synthesis & Prioritization
- **Affinity cluster** similar issues; discuss agreement, impact on UX/business, data gaps, and near/long-term fixes.  
- Identify candidates to target in **upcoming usability tests**.  
- Note: heuristics are **guidelines, not laws**—validate with research before intentionally violating them.  

### 4) (Optional) Workshop Pattern
- **Present heuristics** to the product team; have them place issues on screens.  
- **Run simultaneous evaluation sessions** to surface and resolve knowledge gaps.  
- **Example scoping (field workshop):** P&D Ops (Deliver/ Pick up shipments, Search a PRO, View trailer manifest); Dock Ops (Load shipments, Close trailer, Bill Entry).  

## Templates / Canvases / Frameworks

### NN/g Heuristic Evaluation Workbook (PDF)
- **Structure:** One page per heuristic with prompts and **Issues/Recommendations** fields.  
- **Use it to:** Capture violations and suggested fixes during Pass 2, mapped to each heuristic.  

### Spreadsheet Template (Google Sheets)
- **Pattern:** Record **one observation per row** and tag it with the corresponding heuristic.  

### Digital Whiteboard Setup
- Create **separate boards** per evaluator; add **screenshots** and allow sticky notes over UI elements; restrict visibility until evaluations complete.  

## Aftermath / Follow-ups

- Merge duplicates; finalize an **issues list with recommendations** (by heuristic).  
- **Prioritize** via clustering & impact discussion; align on **short- vs long-term** actions.  
- Plan **usability testing** to validate high-risk areas and rule-breaking trade-offs.  

## Best Practices & Pitfalls

- **Use multiple evaluators (3–5)**; each person will miss some issues alone.  
- **Maintain independence** during capture to avoid bias.  
- **Timebox evaluations** (~1–2 hours).  
- **Narrow scope** for deeper, more actionable findings.  
- **Context matters:** A heuristic “violation” isn’t automatically a bug—validate with users.  
- **Pair with usability testing;** do not treat this as a standalone substitute.  

## Tools & Resources

- **NN/g Workbook (PDF)** — evaluator prompts + per-heuristic capture.  
- **Google Sheets Template** — structured, sortable findings log.  
- **Whiteboards (Miro/Mural)** — screenshot-based sticky-note capture with independent boards.  
- **Heuristics Reference:** Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics.  

## FAQ / Quick Answers

- **How many evaluators do we need?**  
  *3–5 people, independently reviewing the same interface.*  

- **How long should it take?**  
  *Plan ~1–2 hours per evaluator for the independent pass, plus time to synthesize as a group.*  

- **What’s the best way to capture findings?**  
  *Use the NN/g workbook, a spreadsheet (one observation per row), or separate whiteboards with screenshots—keep notes independent until everyone finishes.*  

- **Does a heuristic violation always require a fix?**  
  *No; heuristics are guidelines. Evaluate trade-offs and validate with user research.*
