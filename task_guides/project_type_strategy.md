# Guide for Defining Product Design Project Type and Choosing the Right Design Strategy

> **Executive Summary**  
> This guide helps teams define the type of product design project they are dealing with and select the right UX strategy to match. It combines frameworks for UX maturity, process mapping, and design strategy selection to ensure business and user goals are aligned. By classifying projects and applying the appropriate design approach, organizations can reduce risk, improve usability, and maximize business impact.

---

## Overview

- **Purpose:** Provide a structured way to classify design projects and match them with the right UX/design strategy.  
- **Scope:** Applicable to startups, product teams, and corporations seeking UX maturity and growth.  
- **Audience:** Product managers, UX leads, designers, researchers, and business stakeholders.  
- **Success Criteria:**  
  - Correctly identify project type.  
  - Select design strategy that aligns business and user goals.  
  - Improve usability, adoption, conversion, or innovation as required.  

---

## Preparation

- **Assess UX Maturity:**  
  - Use scorecards to evaluate usability activities, research practices, team understanding, and readiness for change.  
  - Identify weak points (e.g., lack of usability testing, low customer research) and strengths (e.g., agile adaptability).  

- **Map Current vs Desired Process:**  
  - Document the current design and development workflow.  
  - Identify gaps such as unclear requirements, lack of user input, or late approvals.  
  - Define desired workflows emphasizing documentation, roles, user research, collaboration, and retrospectives.  

- **Checklist:**  
  - [ ] Clarify business goals and success metrics.  
  - [ ] Align with brand and product strategy.  
  - [ ] Identify stakeholders and their perspectives.  
  - [ ] Assess available resources (team, tools, time).  
  - [ ] Determine UX maturity level.

## Main Flow / Process

### Step 1: Define the Project Type

Common project situations and their implications:  
1. **Idea Validation / MVP**  
   - Risk: built on assumptions.  
   - Approach: User research → Double Diamond → Design Sprint validation.  

2. **Increasing Conversion Rates**  
   - Problem: Users visit but don’t buy.  
   - Approach: Analytics + quantitative research → CRO framework → A/B testing.  

3. **Improving Usability**  
   - Problem: Drop-offs, friction in tasks.  
   - Approach: Heuristic evaluation + usability testing rounds.  

4. **Increasing Engagement Rates**  
   - Problem: Users churn after initial adoption.  
   - Approach: Hook Model → Habit-forming features → Value-driven KPIs.  

5. **Increasing Acquisition Rates**  
   - Problem: Good product, low discovery.  
   - Approach: Validate market need → Growth Hacking framework.  

6. **Market Repositioning**  
   - Problem: New target audiences needed.  
   - Approach: Double Diamond research → Design Sprints for new features.  

7. **Corporate Innovation**  
   - Problem: Market leadership decline.  
   - Approach: Design Thinking workshops → Vision reset.

### Step 2: Choose the Right Design Strategy

- **Double Diamond** → Discovery, definition, design, delivery. Best for research-heavy or repositioning projects.  
- **Design Sprints** → Fast validation of ideas. Best for MVPs and new features.  
- **Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)** → Best for conversion problems.  
- **Hook Model** → Best for engagement-driven projects.  
- **Growth Hacking** → Best for acquisition and visibility.  
- **Design Thinking Workshops** → Best for corporate innovation.

### Step 3: Map UX Strategy to Business Strategy

- Ask executives:  
  - What makes the business successful?  
  - How does it make money?  
  - Which 5 metrics define success?  
- Align UX goals with these metrics.  
- Integrate brand strategy, style guides, and tone of voice early.  

---

## Templates / Frameworks

- **UX Maturity Scorecard** → Rate usability activities, research practices, willingness to apply findings.  
- **Current vs Desired Process Map** → Highlight inefficiencies and ideal practices.  
- **Design Sprint Agenda**:  
  - Round 1: Quick idea generation (10 min).  
  - Round 2: Expand ideas (10 min).  
  - Round 3: Large sketch + detail (30 min).  
  - Round 4: Present, critique, vote (60 min).  
  - Wrap-up: Finalize deliverable (25 min).  
- **Edgar Schein’s Culture Model** → Understand shared assumptions, values, and artifacts that shape design culture.  

---

## Aftermath / Follow-ups

- Document lessons learned in retrospectives.  
- Update UI style guides and design systems.  
- Conduct post-launch usability testing and QA.  
- Evangelize findings across the organization (brown bag sessions, journey mapping workshops).  

---

## Best Practices & Pitfalls

- **Do:**  
  - Tie UX directly to business KPIs.  
  - Conduct both qualitative and quantitative research.  
  - Keep design and research close.  
  - Celebrate team wins.  

- **Avoid:**  
  - Building on assumptions.  
  - Relying only on market research instead of user research.  
  - Isolating UX under marketing/product without influence.  
  - Letting approval bottlenecks derail design.  

---

## Tools & Resources

- **Frameworks:** Double Diamond, CRO, Hook Model, Growth Hacking, Design Sprints, Design Thinking.  
- **Collaboration Tools:** Persona walls, journey mapping workshops, design studios.  
- **Metrics:** A/B testing tools, analytics dashboards, UX scorecards.
