## Main Flow / Process

### Step 1: Collect Data
- Conduct contextual interviews, ethnographic studies, and observations.  
- Avoid over-relying on surveys.  
- Capture demographics only as context—focus on **behaviors, motivations, and goals**.

### Step 2: Identify Behavioral Variables
- Determine axes such as **price sensitivity vs. feature-driven decisions**, or **early adopter vs. late adopter**.  
- Focus on behavior over demographics.

### Step 3: Map Subjects to Behavioral Axes
- Place each interview subject along relevant spectrums.  
- Compare and contrast patterns.

### Step 4: Identify Significant Behavior Patterns
- Group similar clusters.  
- Look for common motivations, frustrations, and workflows.  

### Step 5: Synthesize Personas
- Create 1 profile per behavior pattern.  
- Include:
  - Name, age, photo, role tag (e.g., “Tinkering Tom”).  
  - Goals, frustrations, motivations.  
  - Skills and experience relevant to your product.  
  - Context of use (device, frequency, environment).  
  - A relatable story or scenario.  
  - Key quotes to capture mindset.  

### Step 6: Define Primary and Secondary Personas
- Primary persona = most critical user to satisfy.  
- Secondary personas = other groups whose needs should not be blocked.

### Step 7: Expand with Details
- Add narratives of workday, challenges, and success measures.  
- Include environment, tools, and organizational context.  
- Show relationships, influences, and future aspirations.

## Best Practices & Pitfalls

**Do:**  
- Base on real behavioral research.  
- Involve stakeholders early to ensure buy-in.  
- Humanize personas with names, photos, and stories.  
- Use personas as alignment tools when leadership has assumptions.  

**Avoid:**  
- Reusing personas across unrelated products.  
- Making personas demographic caricatures.  
- Creating too many personas (3–7 is ideal).  
- Treating personas as static (update them as behaviors shift).
