# The Complete Guide to Design Pitches and Elevator Pitches

> **Executive Summary** — This guide provides comprehensive frameworks for crafting and delivering effective design pitches and elevator pitches. It covers the anatomy of a full design pitch (8 steps from general to particular), creating concise elevator pitches (30 seconds or less), and practical techniques for communicating design value to stakeholders, employers, and clients. Learn to structure arguments, eliminate jargon, focus on benefits, and open conversations rather than close deals.

## Overview & Objectives

- **Purpose:** Enable designers to articulate their value, ideas, and solutions effectively through structured pitches
- **Scope:** Covers both formal design pitches (presentations) and elevator pitches (30-second introductions)
- **Audience:** UX/UI designers, product designers, design managers, and anyone pitching design work
- **Success Criteria:**
 - Deliver compelling 30-second elevator pitches
 - Structure comprehensive design presentations
 - Open meaningful conversations about design value
 - Align stakeholders on problems and solutions

## Part 1: The Elevator Pitch (30 Seconds or Less)

### Core Philosophy
**An elevator pitch is NOT meant to "seal the deal"** — 30 seconds isn't enough to convince someone to hire you or buy your product. Instead, **it IS meant to open a conversation** by being so fascinating that the listener responds with "Tell me more!"

### The 6-Step Formula

#### 1. Include the Fundamentals
Traditional structure with 3 elements:
- **Introduction:** Who you are and what you do
- **Problem/Solution:** What problem you solve and how
- **Value Proposition:** The results of your solution

Example: "Hi, I'm Alexa. I'm a UX designer. A lot of people struggle to use software products, especially on their phones. I conduct user research and create wireframes that help optimize mobile usability so software companies reduce churn and make more money."

#### 2. Eliminate the Introduction
Delete "Hi, I'm [Name]. I'm a [title]" — introductions happen naturally anyway. Jump straight to the value.

#### 3. Focus on Benefits, Not Features
- **Remove task lists:** Delete "I conduct user research and create wireframes"
- **Remove jargon metrics:** Delete "reduce churn and make money"
- **Keep the impact:** Focus on how lives/businesses improve

#### 4. Skip the Jargon
Replace technical terms with plain language:
- Instead of: "I optimize the mobile usability of your app interfaces"
- Use: "I make your software easier to use on mobile devices"

#### 5. Achieve Radical Clarity
- **Maximum 75 words** (ideally less)
- **15-30 seconds** when spoken aloud
- Every word must earn its place

Best example (8 words): "I write the only newsletter anyone opens anymore." - Laura Belgray

#### 6. Practice Relentlessly
- Say it aloud daily in the mirror
- Practice with colleagues over lunch
- Test with people outside your field
- Refine based on reactions

### The 5-Question Framework

Build your pitch by answering:
1. **Who are you?** (Your design specialty)
2. **What do you do?** (Specific deliverables)
3. **Who do you do it for?** (Target audience)
4. **Why do they need it?** (Problem you solve)
5. **How are they changed?** (Transformation/outcome)

Example progression:
- "I'm Gina Raduski and I'm a UX designer"
- "I design websites and apps"
- "for small businesses"
- "so their potential clients can find them"
- "and hire them"

Final: "I'm a UX designer who creates websites and apps that help small businesses get found and hired by their ideal clients."

### Tailoring to Context

Adapt your pitch based on audience:

**For Potential Employers:**
"Hi, I'm Sara, and I've successfully led design projects for mobile apps, which aligns perfectly with your company's focus on expanding into the mobile space. I can help deliver a seamless mobile experience that resonates with your target audience."

**For Clients:**
"I specialize in creating delightful user experiences that boost conversion rates and drive customer loyalty. My last e-commerce redesign led to a 20% increase in user engagement and 15% decrease in bounce rates."

**For Networking:**
"As a UX designer, I apply user-centered design approach, conducting in-depth research and usability testing to create interfaces that not only look great but also meet users' needs and expectations."

### Real-World Examples

- **Morning Brew:** "Become smarter in just 5 minutes. Get the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable."
- **DuckDuckGo:** "Tired of being tracked online? We can help. Get seamless privacy protection on your browser for free."
- **Google (original):** "Organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful."
- **WordPress:** "Create a website in minutes."

## Part 2: The Complete Design Pitch (Presentations)

### The 8-Step Anatomy

#### Step 1: Think from General to Particular
Structure as a funnel:
- **Top level:** Big picture problems, context, strategic summary
- **Middle level:** Specific processes, actors, iterations
- **Bottom level:** Detailed solutions, flows, mockups

This creates **scalable understanding** — stakeholders grasp the overview while practitioners see the details.

#### Step 2: Know Your Audience
Adjust based on who's listening:
- **Executives:** Focus on business impact, ROI
- **Peers:** Include technical details, process
- **Students:** Explain fundamentals, context
- **Cross-functional:** Bridge terminology gaps

This intelligence helps you:
- Define tone and rhythm
- Anticipate questions/pushback
- Control discussion outcomes

#### Step 3: Provide Context
Establish common ground:
- Evidence the problem/opportunity
- Share unified understanding
- State objectives and goals
- Define what success looks like

Without aligned context, discussions diverge into confusion.

#### Step 4: Create an Agenda
Structure prevents failure:
- Order topics logically
- Prioritize key ideas
- Control timing (especially for workshops)
- Show status/progress if ongoing

#### Step 5: State the Argument (Golden Circle)
Follow Simon Sinek's framework:

**WHY (Inner circle - Purpose):**
- The value and cause
- Why this matters
- Example: "We believe in challenging the status quo"

**HOW (Middle circle - Process):**
- The path to achievement
- Processes and milestones
- Example: "Our products are beautifully designed and easy to use"

**WHAT (Outer circle - Result):**
- The final solution
- Example: "We make computers"

#### Step 6: Interaction with Audience
Strategic engagement:
- Control when to open discussion
- Use Step 2 knowledge to anticipate responses
- Guide conversation toward goals
- Recognize when to limit input

#### Step 7: Conclude
Always wrap up clearly:
- Summarize key points
- Confirm shared understanding
- State decisions made
- Prevent assumption gaps

#### Step 8: Define Next Steps
Never leave without clear actions:
- Who does what
- By when
- How to measure
- Next meeting date

### Powerful Techniques

#### Use Comparatives
Show before/after scenarios side-by-side for maximum impact.

#### Killer Facts/Data
Numbers prevent pushback. Use metrics, research findings, and evidence.

#### Metaphor & Storytelling
Connect abstract concepts to familiar experiences (e.g., UX process as a journey).

#### Control Tone & Rhythm
Match energy to audience and objectives. Anticipate resistance points.

#### Planning (Not Plans)
"Plans are worthless, but planning is everything" - Eisenhower. Show concrete roadmaps, not vague intentions.

## Best Practices & Pitfalls

### Do:
- **Keep it conversational** — Avoid sounding rehearsed
- **Show your design process** — Demonstrate methodology
- **Highlight collaborative skills** — Emphasize teamwork
- **Practice with non-designers** — Test clarity
- **Start with the problem** — Not the solution
- **Use evidence** — Support claims with data
- **Create urgency** — Why now matters

### Avoid:
- **Listing tasks** — Focus on outcomes
- **Technical jargon** — Unless audience requires it
- **Overselling** — Let quality speak
- **Rushing delivery** — Pace for comprehension
- **Ignoring questions** — Engage authentically
- **Weak conclusions** — Always summarize
- **Vague next steps** — Be specific
