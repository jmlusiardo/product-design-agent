# Writing Executive Summaries: From Research Insights to Stakeholder Action

> **Executive Summary** — This guide provides practical frameworks for writing compelling executive summaries across research reports, project proposals, and business documents. It covers structure, content selection, formatting best practices, and templates to help you distill complex information into actionable insights that stakeholders will actually read and use for decision-making.

## Overview & Objectives

- **Purpose:** Transform complex research findings and project information into concise, actionable summaries that drive stakeholder decisions.
- **Scope:** Covers executive summaries for UX research reports, project management documents, business proposals, and strategic initiatives.
- **Audience:** UX researchers, product managers, designers, project managers, and business analysts.
- **Success Criteria:** Summaries are read, understood, and used for decision-making; stakeholders can extract key information without reading full reports.

## Understanding Executive Summaries

### What is an Executive Summary?
An executive summary is a concise overview that captures the most critical information from a larger document. It serves as a standalone document that gives readers all essential information needed to understand the project, findings, or proposal without diving into the full details.

### Key Characteristics
- **Length:** Maximum 1-2 pages (strive for 1 page)
- **Audience:** Stakeholders who need quick insights to make decisions
- **Content:** Most impactful findings, recommendations, and business implications
- **Structure:** Problem → Solution → Value → Next Steps

### Types of Executive Summaries
- **Research Reports:** Highlighting key findings, insights, and recommendations
- **Project Proposals:** Outlining objectives, solutions, and expected outcomes
- **Business Cases:** Presenting problems, proposed solutions, and ROI
- **Strategic Plans:** Summarizing goals, initiatives, and success metrics

## Preparation & Content Selection

### Pre-Writing Questions

**For Research Summaries:**
- Which assumptions or hypotheses were validated/invalidated?
- What could have considerable positive impact on users?
- What issues did we uncover that need immediate attention?
- What happened that was completely unexpected?
- What information helps teams make better decisions?

**For Project Summaries:**
- Why is this project happening? (Problem statement)
- What insight, feedback, or need caused it?
- How will this solve the established problem?
- What will happen once the project is finished?
- How does this connect to company goals or OKRs?

### Content Selection Framework

#### The 3-5 Insight Rule
- **1 surprising finding/insight:** Something that changed how you think
- **1-2 negative findings:** Issues, invalidated assumptions, or risks
- **1-2 additional findings:** Unexpected discoveries or decision-enabling information

#### Prioritization Criteria
- Impact on business decisions
- Relevance to stated goals
- Actionability of the insight
- Potential for positive or negative user impact

## Structure & Templates

### Universal Four-Part Structure

#### 1. Problem or Need (What & Why)
- Start with the problem the document addresses
- Include relevant research, customer feedback, or business drivers
- Explain why solving this matters to customers and business

**Example Opening:**
"In recent customer feedback sessions, 52% of customers expressed need for a simpler, cheaper version of our product. In competitor analysis, price was mentioned 87% of the time as a deciding factor."

#### 2. Recommended Solution (How)
- Outline your specific solution or project objectives
- Be prescriptive—convince readers this is the right approach
- Provide high-level overview of deliverables and timeline

**Example Solution:**
"Our new watch series will begin at 20% cheaper than current options, with potential for 40%+ savings through new materials, quartz movement, and customizable bands."

#### 3. Solution Value (Impact & Results)
- Detail expected results and benefits
- Include relevant financial information, risks, and opportunities
- Connect to company goals, OKRs, or strategic objectives
- Address potential concerns proactively

**Example Value:**
"These offerings could generate $3M+ in annual profits, helping achieve FY22's Objective 1. Early feedback indicates minimal impact on luxury brand perception."

#### 4. Conclusion & Next Steps (Action)
- Summarize the importance and impact of the work
- Reference supporting documents
- Provide clear next steps or decisions needed

### Research-Specific Template

For each insight, use this structure:
- **Header:** Short, descriptive title (3-5 words)
- **Learning:** 1-2 sentences of what you discovered
- **Evidence:** Quote, data point, or example demonstrating the finding
- **Consequence:** Business impact or implication
- **Recommendation:** Actionable next step (if relevant)

**Example Research Insight:**
**Flexibility in dates leads to multiple searches**

These travelers are flexible with dates, giving them space to search within ranges for the best trip. However, this results in many different searches and comparing prices across multiple tabs, frustrating users.

"I wanted to see if it was cheaper to take the train on Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday, and it just got so complicated to compare all these searches—it was frustrating."

By forcing users to compare different date possibilities across tabs, we create friction that may drive them to competitors with easier comparison features, potentially losing revenue and retention.

**Recommendation:** Allow users to search with flexible calendar dates within one search to compare options on one screen.

## Best Practices & Common Mistakes

### Do
- **Keep it concise:** Maximum 1 page, ideally shorter
- **Use clear headers:** Make insights scannable
- **Include supporting evidence:** Quotes, data, examples
- **Translate to business language:** Connect to metrics and decisions
- **Balance positive and negative:** Include both successes and issues
- **Make it standalone:** Summary should work without the full document
- **Proofread carefully:** This document represents your work quality

### Avoid
- **Using jargon:** Write for stakeholders outside your immediate team
- **Including too much detail:** Save specifics for the full report
- **Writing a mini-report:** Focus on highlights, not comprehensive coverage
- **Burying the lead:** Put most important information first
- **Making it abstract:** Provide concrete, actionable insights
- **Overwhelming with data:** Select only the most impactful metrics

### Common Pitfalls
- **Length creep:** Multi-page summaries defeat the purpose
- **Academic abstracts:** These aren't literature reviews
- **Missing business connection:** Always tie insights to decisions
- **Generic recommendations:** Make suggestions specific and actionable
- **Poor formatting:** Use bullets, headers, and white space effectively

## Testing & Iteration

### A/B Testing Your Summaries
- Create different versions with varying structures
- Test with different stakeholder groups
- Gather feedback on clarity, usefulness, and actionability
- Iterate based on which versions drive better decisions

### Feedback Questions
- "What's the most important thing you took away?"
- "What information is missing for your decision-making?"
- "What could be clearer or more concise?"
- "Did this change your perspective on the project/findings?"

## Quality Checklist
