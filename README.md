### Usage Tips for Beginners

**Getting Started:**

- Try "What can you help me with?" for a complete capability overview

**Making the Most of Your Setup:**
- **Usage limits**: Pro plan has generous limits; monitor usage in project settings
- **Context retention**: Each chat within the project knows about your uploaded files
- **Organization**: Star your project for quick access from the sidebar

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

**"I don't see the Projects feature"**
- Ensure you have a Claude Pro or Team subscription
- Try refreshing your browser or logging out/in again

**"GitHub upload failed"**
- Try the manual upload method instead
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure the repository URL is correct and accessible

**"Agent isn't responding with specialized guidance"**
- Verify the instructions.md content was properly added to Custom Instructions
- Make sure you're chatting within the project, not the main Claude interface
- Try rephrasing your question or use the onboarding trigger phrase

**"File upload is slow or failing"**
- Try uploading smaller batches of files
- Ensure stable internet connection
