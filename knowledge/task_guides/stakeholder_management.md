# Stakeholder Strategy Playbook: Engagement, Influence & Conflict Navigation

> **Executive Summary** — This guide turns stakeholder “management” into durable **engagement**, so you can identify the right people, understand their motivations, co-create solutions, and secure executive buy-in. Use it to (1) profile and prioritize stakeholders, (2) build an engagement plan, (3) run interviews with strong questions, (4) speak the language of ROI to leadership, and (5) handle common challenging behaviors (“dangerous animals”).

## Overview & Objectives
- **Purpose:** Provide a repeatable path to align stakeholders around outcomes, reduce risk, and accelerate decisions.
- **Scope:** Identification → Profiling → Engagement planning → Interviewing → Co-creation → Reporting & decision-making → Ongoing relationship mgmt.
- **Audience:** Researchers, designers, PMs, engineering leads, design leaders.
- **Success Criteria / KPIs:**  
  - Defined **profiles** for critical stakeholders.  
  - A living **engagement plan** (owner, cadence, objectives).  
  - Decisions framed against executive questions (revenue, cost, new/existing business, long-term value).  
  - Reduced obstacles & clearer resource negotiation.

## Preparation
### Research & Planning
- Shift from “management” to **engagement**: build trust and integrate stakeholder touchpoints into everyday work.
- Map stakeholders across **Business / Engineering / UX** (and any other impacted groups).
- Prepare shared artifacts (digital boards, “UX walls” / artifact rooms) to broadcast context.

### Identification Checklist
- - [ ] List potential stakeholders; capture **power/impact** and **who’s affected**.  
- - [ ] Ask focusing questions (e.g., “Can the project exist without this stakeholder?”).  
- - [ ] Select **critical stakeholders** to prioritize for deeper engagement.

### Stakeholder Profile (capture before 1:1s)
- Include **name**, **custodian/owner**, **engagement objective**, **maturity**, **key concerns & success metrics**, **preferred comms**, **planned engagement level** (Monitor, Consult, Involve, Collaborate, Empower).

## Main Flow / Process
### 1) Kickoff & Framing (30–60 min)
- Clarify **purpose, constraints, timelines, roles**; set comms norms. *(For a full flow, see `kickoff_meeting.md` in your repo.)*  
- Share a **one-page brief** aligned to executive questions (how this work increases revenue / reduces cost / grows new or existing business / strengthens long-term value).

### 2) Discovery via Stakeholder Interviews (30–45 min each)
- Use structured questions to learn **project goals, decisions-to-date, constraints, roles, fears, success, users**.
- End each interview with: **“Who else should we speak with?”**

### 3) Map Needs & Build the Engagement Plan (60–90 min)
- Consolidate interview insights into **profiles**; agree engagement levels & tactics; assign **custodians**.
- Plan **when/how** to collaborate; define checkpoints tied to milestones.

### 4) Co-Creation & Decision Forums (60–120 min as needed)
- Run workshops to **align** and **negotiate** trade-offs; make priorities and evidence explicit.
- Encourage contributions from all roles; capture decisions, owners, and rationale.

### 5) Reporting & Executive Buy-in (15–30 min cadence)
- Report **what’s done / next / obstacles**; explicitly map outcomes to the executive questions.
- Talk in **money terms**: revenue impact, cost reduction, risk mitigation, sustainability.

### 6) Sustain the Relationship (ongoing)
- Keep plans living; as trust grows, cadence may lighten, but shared artifacts remain vital for onboarding and continuity.

## Templates / Canvases / Frameworks
### A) Stakeholder Interview Guide
Use these topic blocks during 1:1s:
- **Project framing:** What is the product? Why now? Goals? Competitors? Decided requirements/tech? Timeline? Team size?
- **Role & interests:** Role, tenure, prior context, personal success definition, worries, preferred involvement, **others to contact**.
- **Users:** Who are/will be customers? Prior research? Primary use contexts? 5–10 year view.

### B) Stakeholder Profile Card (one per stakeholder)
- **Name • Custodian • Objective • Maturity • Key concerns/success metrics • Preferred comms • Engagement level (+ actions/milestones).**

### C) Engagement Plan (team-level)
- **Who** (individual/group), **owner**, **objectives**, **touchpoints & cadence**, **working methods** (Monitor→Empower), **milestones & proof points**.

### D) Executive One-Pager (ROI framing)
Answer for the current initiative:
1) How will this **increase overall revenues**?  
2) How will it **decrease operational costs**?  
3) How will it **increase revenue from new business**?  
4) How will it **increase revenue from existing business**?  
5) How will it **increase long-term value**?

### E) Decision Log (lightweight)
- **Date • Decision • Options considered • Criteria • Chosen option • Rationale (tie to executive questions) • Owner • Due/Review date.**

## Aftermath / Follow-ups
- **Share-outs:** Summaries of decisions, owners & due dates; updated profiles/plan.
- **Onboarding:** Use profiles and the plan to ramp new team members quickly.
- **Retros:** Review engagement effectiveness; adjust levels/cadence and update artifacts.

## Best Practices & Pitfalls
### Do
- **Integrate engagement** into routines; don’t treat it as a side process.
- **Mitigate risk early** via early engineering + stakeholder collaboration.
- **Report regularly** with clear goals and mutual accountability.
- **Translate design to outcomes executives value** (speak money).

### Avoid
- One-size-fits-all approaches; engagement is **context-driven**.
- Vanity metrics that don’t reflect outcomes.
- “Swoop and poop” surprises — reduce them with visibility and cadence.

## Handling Common “Dangerous Animals”
- **HiPPO (Highest Paid Person’s Opinion):** Counter with evidence and outcome framing; propose small, time-boxed tests when opinions conflict.  
- **RHiNO (Really High-value New Opportunity):** Stay in the **problem space**; validate assumptions and total cost before pivoting.  
- **ZEBRA (Zero Evidence but Really Arrogant):** Surface assumptions; require validation before committing major resources.  
- **Seagull Manager:** Reduce swoops with scheduled check-ins and transparent artifacts; summarize decisions and invite feedback within a defined window.  
- **WoLF (Works on Latest Fire):** Protect outcomes by making trade-offs explicit; reserve capacity for strategic work.

## Tools & Resources
- **Collaboration/Visibility:** Digital boards (e.g., Miro), artifact rooms for persistent context.
- **Profiles/Plans:** Structure profile cards & engagement plans with clear owners, cadences, and milestones.

## Cross-Guide Linkage (Your Repo)
- **Kickoff Meetings (`kickoff_meeting.md`):** Use for kickoff agenda, time-boxes, and materials; reference it in **Main Flow — Step 1**.  
- **Arguing Design Decisions & Managing Difficult Conversations (`difficult_conversations.md`):** Use during **Co-Creation** and **Reporting** steps to structure rationale, handle objections, and navigate conflict.

## Optimization Opportunities (for this Guide)
- Add **“See also” hooks** at each step (Kickoff → Step 1; Co-Creation/Reporting → Difficult Conversations).  
- Include the **Decision Log template** (above) to standardize documentation.  
- Create a **Profile & Plan worksheet** mirroring the fields here to ensure consistent capture across projects.  
- Append a **Metrics Glossary** that flags vanity vs. outcome metrics.
