# Guide to Creating User Journey Maps and Event Storming Workshops

> **Executive Summary**  
> This guide explains how to create **Customer Journey Maps** and run **Event Storming** workshops. Both methods are powerful for visualizing user experiences, uncovering pain points, and aligning teams. Journey maps focus on a single persona‚Äôs emotional experience across phases, while event storming maps system-level events and frictions to clarify business processes.

## Overview

- **Purpose**: Visualize user experiences, identify friction points, and align cross-functional teams on customer goals.  
- **Scope**: Covers journey maps (persona-driven narratives) and event storming (domain-driven process events).  
- **Audience**: UX designers, product managers, developers, and stakeholders.  
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Clear mapping of actions, thoughts, and emotions (Journey Maps).
  - Identification of key events, hotspots, and system interactions (Event Storming).
  - Prioritized pain points and opportunities for improvements.

## Preparation

### Research & Planning
- Define persona(s) and scenario(s).
- Clarify scope of the journey (end-to-end vs. partial flow).
- Collect data: user research, customer interviews, analytics, and system logs.

### Checklist
- [ ] Define persona and user goal.
- [ ] Gather input from multiple stakeholders (support, sales, dev, etc.).
- [ ] Collect customer quotes, pain points, and expectations.
- [ ] Prepare workshop tools (digital boards like Miro, sticky notes, markers).
- [ ] Define clear start and end points for the mapping.

## Customer Journey Mapping

### Structure
1. **Persona + Scenario**: Define a single persona and situation.  
2. **Expectations/Goals**: Note what the user hopes to achieve.  
3. **Phases**: Break down into major stages (Define, Compare, Negotiate, Select).  
4. **Actions**: List user activities at each stage.  
5. **Thoughts & Emotions**: Capture internal reactions, quotes, or frustrations.  
6. **Opportunities**: Highlight potential improvements.  
7. **Internal Ownership**: Assign departments or teams responsible.

### Key Principles
- Chronological flow from start to goal.
- One journey map per persona (1:1 mapping).
- Must include **pain points**‚Äîotherwise, it‚Äôs incomplete.
- Outputs: clear touchpoints for improvement, shared organizational understanding.

## Event Storming

### Purpose
- Messier but more comprehensive than journey maps.
- Maps **domain events** across systems and stakeholders.
- Useful for uncovering bottlenecks, hotspots, and system interactions.

### Process
1. **Map All Events**  
   - Capture events from start (Day 0) to goal completion.  
   - Use orange sticky notes in ‚ÄúNoun + Past Tense Verb‚Äù format.  

2. **Group Events into Milestones**  
   - Identify big phases or user milestones.  
   - Consolidate duplicates.  

3. **Clean Up & Categorize**  
   - **User struggles (frictions)**  
   - **User success moments**  
   - **Ideas and design opportunities**  
   - **Technical details & risks**  

4. **Prioritize Events**  
   - Use voting (e.g., 35 votes per person in 7 minutes).  
   - Identify top pain points and success factors.  

### Types of Notes (Legend)
- üü® **Key Event**: Critical for success.  
- üüß **Event**: Past-tense occurrence in the process.  
- üü© **People**: Roles involved.  
- üü¶ **Terminal Event**: Ends the process (e.g., cancellation).  
- ü©∑ **System**: Tools or systems used.  
- üü• **Hotspot**: Current friction or unresolved issue.  

### Tips
- Start simple: map the ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù first.  
- Break long journeys into multiple phases.  
- Ensure domain experts can narrate the journey using only events.  
- Pay attention to **early events**‚Äîfixing them often has the biggest impact.  

---

## Aftermath / Follow-ups

- Share consolidated journey map or event storming output with all stakeholders.  
- Assign ownership of key touchpoints or pain points.  
- Define measurable actions (e.g., reduce support call time, simplify onboarding).  
- Revisit maps periodically to track progress and adapt.

## Best Practices & Pitfalls

### Do
- Focus on the **user‚Äôs perspective** (not internal processes).  
- Involve cross-functional teams (UX, support, dev, sales).  
- Document emotions and quotes to keep it grounded in reality.  
- Prioritize improvements‚Äîdon‚Äôt try to fix everything at once.  

### Avoid
- Mapping without real data (assumptions only).  
- Overcomplicating early drafts‚Äîstart broad, refine later.  
- Ignoring hotspots or terminal events.  
- Treating mapping as a one-time activity‚Äîshould be iterative.
