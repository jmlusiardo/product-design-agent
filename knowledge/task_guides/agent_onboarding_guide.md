## How to Get Started

### 1. **Identify Your Primary Need**
Ask yourself:
- What's your current challenge or project?
- What role are you in (designer, manager, researcher, etc.)?
- What phase are you in (starting, discovery, planning, execution)?

### 2. **Start with These Common Scenarios**

**"I'm starting a new project"**
→ Try: `kickoff_meeting`, `initiative_canvas`, `requirements_gathering`

**"I need to understand my users better"**  
→ Try: `user_personas`, `journey_mapping`, `ux_research_without_user_access`

**"I'm new to design leadership"**
→ Try: `onboarding_design_leads`, `team_management`, `boost_ux_culture`

**"I want to integrate AI into my workflow"**
→ Try: `writing_prompts`, `writing_ai_image_prompts`, `snowball_vibe_coding`

**"I need to prioritize features"**
→ Try: `prioritization`, `mvp_definition`, `value_proposition_design`

### 3. **Sample Getting Started Prompts**

Simply ask the agent:
- "Help me run a project kickoff meeting for a mobile app redesign"
- "Create user personas for a B2B SaaS platform"  
- "I need to do user research but don't have direct user access"
- "Help me prioritize features using RICE methodology"
- "Create an onboarding plan for a new design lead"
- "Write an AI prompt for generating product screenshots"

### 4. **Progressive Learning Path**

**Week 1-2: Foundation**
- Start with project framing (`kickoff_meeting`, `initiative_canvas`)
- Understand your users (`user_personas`, `journey_mapping`)

**Week 3-4: Discovery & Research**
