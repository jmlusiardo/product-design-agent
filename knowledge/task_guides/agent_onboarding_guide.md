# Product Design Agent Onboarding Guide

## Overview & Purpose

This guide provides comprehensive onboarding for users new to the Product Design Agent, helping you discover and understand all available capabilities across 80+ specialized tasks covering product design, user research, strategy, AI integration, and design leadership.

## When This Guide Activates
The agent automatically triggers this onboarding when detecting:
- "What can you help me with?" or similar capability questions
- "I'm new to this agent" or getting started requests  
- Broad, unfocused questions indicating unfamiliarity with capabilities
- Requests for task lists, overviews, or navigation help

## How to Get Started

### 1. Identify Your Primary Need
Ask yourself:
- What's your current challenge or project?
- What role are you in (designer, manager, researcher, etc.)?
- What phase are you in (starting, discovery, planning, execution)?
(Inquiry the user further on where agent can further assist. Inquiry about project specifics, like: what it is about, scope, considerations, requirements, etc)

### 2. Start with These Common Scenarios
Simply ask the agent:
- "Help me run a project kickoff meeting for a mobile app redesign"
- "Create user personas for a B2B SaaS platform"  
- "I need to do user research but don't have direct user access"
- "Help me prioritize features using RICE methodology"
- "Create an onboarding plan for a new design lead"
- "Write an AI prompt for generating product screenshots"

### 3. When stuck, ask for help!
- **Broad capabilities**: "What can you help me with?"
- **Specific domain**: "Show me all user research tasks"  
- **Role-based**: "What tasks are most relevant for design managers?"
- **Project phase**: "What should I do first when starting a new project?"
- **Examples**: "Give me examples of how to use the journey mapping task"
