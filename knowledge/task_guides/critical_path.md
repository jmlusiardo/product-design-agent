# Critical Path Mapping Guide

## Executive Summary

Critical Path Mapping creates a step-by-step visual representation of the user's most important journey from problem identification to solution. This technique helps design teams identify key touchpoints, prioritize features, and understand the essential flow users must navigate to achieve their goals.

**Key Deliverable:** A linear flow diagram showing critical user steps
**Time Required:** 15-30 minutes  
**Team Size:** 3-8 participants
**Materials:** Whiteboard/digital canvas, markers/drawing tools

## Prerequisites

- **Completed Problem Statement** - Must have clear, agreed-upon problem definition
- **Basic User Understanding** - General knowledge of target user personas
- **Team Alignment** - All participants understand the core problem being solved

## Quickstart Checklist

- [ ] Problem statement document ready and reviewed
- [ ] Whiteboard or digital canvas prepared
- [ ] All team members present and aligned on problem
- [ ] Facilitator designated for drawing/guiding discussion
- [ ] 15-30 minute time block reserved

## Procedure

### Step 1: Problem Statement Foundation
Start with your agreed-upon Problem Statement as the first step in the critical path. Write it clearly at the beginning of your flow diagram.

### Step 2: Identify User Starting Point  
**Facilitator Action:** Draw the problem statement as the starting point
**Team Discussion:** Determine where users are when they first encounter this problem

### Step 3: Map Sequential Steps
**Process:**
1. Facilitator stands at whiteboard and facilitates drawing
2. As a group, identify the next logical step users take
3. Continue adding steps in sequence until reaching solution
4. Draw connections between each step like a subway/bus route map

### Step 4: Focus on Critical Experience
**Key Questions to Guide Mapping:**
- What is the most important user story for this sprint?
- Which steps are absolutely essential vs. nice-to-have?
- Where do users typically get stuck or drop off?

### Step 5: Validate Completeness
Review the complete path from problem to solution ensuring no critical gaps exist.

## Context-Specific Applications

### First-Time User Experience
Focus on steps from discovering your product through successful onboarding and initial value realization.

### New Product Concept Development  
Map the ideal future state showing value proposition and core feature interactions for engaged users.

### Conversion Rate Optimization
Understand why users land on your page and map their goal-achievement journey.

## Examples

### E-commerce Critical Path
```markdown
Problem: Need specific product →
Search/Browse →
Product Discovery →
Product Evaluation →
Add to Cart →
Checkout Process →
Purchase Completion →
Order Confirmation
```

### SaaS Onboarding Critical Path
```css
Problem: Workflow inefficiency →
Discover Tool →
Sign Up →
Initial Setup →
First Use Case →
See Value/Results →
Integrate into Workflow
```

## Visual Format Guidelines

**Linear Flow Structure:** Steps should flow like a subway map - clear, sequential, easy to follow
**Step Representation:** Use boxes or circles for each major step
**Connections:** Clear arrows or lines showing progression
**Annotations:** Brief descriptions under each step explaining user goals/actions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem:** Team can't agree on starting point
**Solution:** Return to problem statement and clarify who experiences this problem and in what context

**Problem:** Too many detailed sub-steps cluttering the map
**Solution:** Focus only on major milestones; save detailed steps for later task breakdown

**Problem:** Multiple possible paths emerge
**Solution:** Choose the single most critical/common path; document alternatives separately

**Problem:** Path becomes too complex/branching
**Solution:** Simplify to linear progression; complex flows indicate need for path prioritization

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] Path flows logically from problem to solution
- [ ] Each step represents meaningful user progress
- [ ] No critical gaps exist between steps
- [ ] Team consensus on path importance and accuracy
- [ ] Visual clarity supports easy comprehension

## Follow-Up Activities

**Immediate Next Steps:**
- User story creation for each critical step
- Feature prioritization based on path importance
- Prototype planning focusing on critical touchpoints

**Integration Points:**
- Use critical path to guide user journey mapping
- Reference during feature prioritization discussions
- Validate design decisions against critical path flow
