# Running Brainstormings: A Practical Guide to Productive Idea Generation

> **Executive Summary** — This guide consolidates best practices, rules, and frameworks for running successful brainstorming sessions. It covers preparation, facilitation techniques, creative exercises, and structured evaluation methods to ensure diverse, high-quality idea generation. It combines insights from design workshops, Six Thinking Hats, and modern ideation practices.

## Overview

- **Purpose:** Provide a structured playbook for organizing and facilitating brainstormings that are creative, inclusive, and outcome-driven.
- **Scope:** From preparation to aftermath — includes rules, frameworks (e.g., Six Thinking Hats), exercises, and pitfalls to avoid.
- **Audience:** Product managers, designers, researchers, engineers, facilitators, and cross-functional teams.
- **Success Criteria:**
  - Sessions generate a broad, documented set of ideas.
  - Participants feel heard, safe, and engaged.
  - Clear next steps and follow-ups are established.

## Preparation

### Research & Planning
- Define a clear **goal statement** (“We want to generate solutions for X problem”).
- Ground ideas in **user research** (don’t skip discovery).
- Decide **scope** (narrow = focus, wide = exploration).
- Prepare guiding questions and constraints (e.g., “What if we had only 2 weeks?”).

### Roles
- **Facilitator:** Runs the session, enforces rules, manages energy.
- **Timekeeper:** Keeps activities on schedule.
- **Documenter:** Captures artifacts, notes, and photos.
- **Participants:** Diverse, 5–8 active contributors is ideal.

### Logistics
- Choose fully **in-person or fully remote** (hybrid dilutes voices).
- Tools: Whiteboards, Post-its, or digital boards (Miro, Whimsical, Figma).
- Materials: Sticky notes, sketch sheets, dot stickers, markers.

### Checklist
- - [ ] Session goal written and shared.
- - [ ] Attendees confirmed (small, diverse, relevant).
- - [ ] Research insights summarized for context.
- - [ ] Activities pre-planned and time-boxed.
- - [ ] Whiteboard/slides pre-structured.
- - [ ] Brainstorming rules posted.
- - [ ] Breaks scheduled; energizers prepared.

## Main Flow / Process

### 1) Opening (10 minutes)
- Welcome participants and set **ground rules**:
  - Defer judgment
  - Encourage wild ideas
  - Build on others
  - Stay on topic
  - One conversation at a time
  - Be visual
  - Go for quantity
- Use an **improv warm-up** (Alphabet, Three Things, Sound Ball) to reset focus.

### 2) Divergence — Idea Generation
- **Solo first, group later:** Write ideas individually, then share aloud.
- **Methods:**
  - Brainstorm with Post-its (physical/virtual).
  - “Crazy 8s” sketching (8 ideas in 8 frames, ~1 min each).
  - Prompts: “What if we had unlimited budget?” “What if we had 2 weeks?”
- **Six Thinking Hats rotation:**
  - White: Facts & gaps  
  - Red: Emotions, gut instincts  
  - Yellow: Positives, benefits  
  - Black: Risks, constraints  
  - Green: Creativity, alternatives  
  - Blue: Process, summary [oai_citation:0‡The Six Thinking Hats.pdf](file-service://file-8j3rTzyggBNn6YFUsjrAoD)

### 3) Convergence — Structuring & Evaluating
- Cluster ideas by theme (affinity diagram).
- Share sketches equally (upload/put on wall).
- Dot-vote or upvote ideas to highlight resonance.
- Summarize themes with pros/cons (parallel evaluation).
- Decide top ideas to carry into prototypes, experiments, or further research.

### 4) Wrap-up (10 minutes)
- Recap **outputs** (photos, clusters, votes).
- Assign authorship and next steps.
- Gather feedback on the session itself.
- Share recap to all participants and stakeholders.

## Templates / Frameworks

### Brainstorming Rules Poster (IDEO’s 7 Rules)

**Purpose:** Establish a shared contract for collaboration. Prevents premature evaluation, ensures quantity, and makes the session safe for creativity [oai_citation:0‡14 tips on running a successful product design workshop.pdf](file-service://file-AoA11FpN3jXPajs1azPPUS) [oai_citation:1‡Ideation for Everyday Design Challenges - NN_G.pdf](file-service://file-BhGV5gBn9ci1fQpTwCiY6v).  

**Rules to Display (adapted from IDEO and NN/g):**
1. **Defer judgment** — Postpone evaluation until later.
2. **Encourage wild ideas** — Push beyond obvious solutions.
3. **Build on others’ ideas** — Say “yes, and…” rather than “no, but…”.
4. **Stay focused** — Keep tied to the challenge/problem statement.
5. **One conversation at a time** — Avoid cross-talk and dominance.
6. **Be visual** — Use sketches, diagrams, and icons.
7. **Go for quantity** — More ideas = higher chance of innovation.

**Process for Use:**
- Print or display these rules on slides/whiteboard at the start of the session.  
- Facilitator quickly reviews each before starting divergence.  
- Keep visible throughout to gently remind participants if behaviors drift.

### Six Thinking Hats — Detailed Guide

**Origin:** Developed by Edward de Bono (1985), *Six Thinking Hats* is a structured method for parallel thinking. Instead of debating, participants explore a topic from six distinct perspectives (“hats”). This prevents groupthink, reduces conflict, and ensures creativity is balanced with analysis [oai_citation:0‡The Six Thinking Hats.pdf](file-service://file-BVWNZ4PeS1gaXrZCSmEGgF).  

---

#### Core Principles

- **Parallel Thinking:** Everyone wears the same hat at the same time. This avoids adversarial debates and keeps the group aligned.
- **Switching Hats:** Participants consciously shift modes of thinking (e.g., from optimism to caution), broadening exploration.
- **Equal Legitimacy:** Emotions, facts, creativity, and risks all get structured airtime.

---

#### The Six Hats in Detail

1. ⚪ **White Hat — Facts & Information**
   - **Focus:** Neutral data, evidence, knowns and unknowns.
   - **Questions to ask:**
     - What information do we have?
     - What’s missing?
     - How can we obtain it?
   - **Best Practices:**
     - Stick to verifiable data, not opinions.
     - Separate facts from assumptions.
   - **Use case:** At the start, to ground brainstorming in reality.

---

2. 🔴 **Red Hat — Feelings & Intuition**
   - **Focus:** Emotions, hunches, and gut reactions without justification.
   - **Questions to ask:**
     - What’s your immediate gut reaction?
     - How does this idea make you feel?
   - **Best Practices:**
     - Allow expression without requiring logic.
     - Capture honest first impressions (positive or negative).
   - **Use case:** Early in brainstorming to surface hidden biases or enthusiasm.

---

3. 🟡 **Yellow Hat — Optimism & Benefits**
   - **Focus:** Positives, feasibility, and potential value.
   - **Questions to ask:**
     - What are the benefits of this option?
     - Why could this work?
     - What strengths or opportunities exist here?
   - **Best Practices:**
     - Encourage looking for hidden value in even “wild” ideas.
     - Make optimism deliberate, not naïve.
   - **Use case:** After initial ideas, to spotlight potential and build confidence.

---

4. ⚫ **Black Hat — Caution & Critical Thinking**
   - **Focus:** Risks, weaknesses, and potential failure points.
   - **Questions to ask:**
     - Why might this not work?
     - What regulations, costs, or practical barriers exist?
     - What could go wrong?
   - **Best Practices:**
     - Apply fairly and constructively.
     - Avoid overuse — too much black hat too early kills creativity.
   - **Use case:** After yellow hat, to balance optimism with realism.

---

5. 🟢 **Green Hat — Creativity & Alternatives**
   - **Focus:** Innovation, provocations, and alternative paths.
   - **Questions to ask:**
     - What other ideas exist?
     - How else could we solve this?
     - Could we flip assumptions?
   - **Best Practices:**
     - Encourage lateral thinking and unexpected connections.
     - Push participants beyond comfort zones (Crazy 8s pairs well here).
   - **Use case:** In middle or end of session, to expand before deciding.

---

6. 🔵 **Blue Hat — Process Control & Summary**
   - **Focus:** Managing thinking process, sequencing hats, and summarizing.
   - **Questions to ask:**
     - What’s the agenda?
     - Which hat should we try next?
     - Can we summarize where we are?
   - **Best Practices:**
     - Facilitator typically “wears” blue hat most of the time.
     - Helps close loops, capture outcomes, and guide flow.
   - **Use case:** At start (set agenda) and end (summarize insights/decisions).

---

#### Example Agenda for a Brainstorming Session

1. 🔵 Blue Hat (5 min): Define the challenge, set agenda.  
2. ⚪ White Hat (10 min): Review facts, knowns, unknowns.  
3. 🔴 Red Hat (5 min): Capture gut reactions and emotions.  
4. 🟡 Yellow Hat (10 min): Explore benefits and opportunities.  
5. ⚫ Black Hat (10 min): Assess risks and challenges.  
6. 🟢 Green Hat (15 min): Generate creative alternatives and provocations.  
7. 🔵 Blue Hat (10 min): Summarize insights, shortlist, and plan next steps.  

---

#### Tips for Facilitation

- **Time-box each hat** (5–15 min) to maintain energy.  
- **Visual aids:** Use slides or columns on a whiteboard with hat colors.  
- **Participation:** Rotate turns to avoid dominance; use silent writing first if needed.  
- **Balance:** Don’t let Black Hat dominate; ensure Green and Yellow have space.  
- **Wrap-up:** Document outputs per hat (facts, feelings, benefits, risks, ideas, summary).  

---

#### Benefits of Using Six Hats

- Ensures **balanced exploration** of a problem.  
- Reduces adversarial debates (“my idea vs. yours”).  
- Brings out **hidden perspectives** (emotional, intuitive, cautious).  
- Structures brainstorms into **parallel thinking**, boosting productivity and creativity.

### Crazy 8s Worksheet

**Purpose:** Push participants to go beyond their first idea and generate multiple concepts quickly [oai_citation:4‡14 tips on running a successful product design workshop.pdf](file-service://file-AoA11FpN3jXPajs1azPPUS).  

**Setup:**
- One sheet of paper folded into 8 sections (or use digital template).
- Each participant gets their own sheet.

**Process for Use:**
1. Facilitator sets timer for ~8 minutes.  
2. Participants sketch 1 idea per box — aim for speed, not polish.  
3. After time, participants briefly explain their sheet to the group or pin them to wall/board.  
4. Optionally follow with dot-voting to identify which sketches resonate.  

**Benefits:**
- Forces divergence and quantity over quality.  
- Breaks fixation on first idea.  
- Easy to integrate into both in-person and remote workshops.  

---

### Affinity Clustering Canvas

**Purpose:** Organize large sets of raw ideas into meaningful themes for discussion and prioritization [oai_citation:5‡Ideation for Everyday Design Challenges - NN_G.pdf](file-service://file-BhGV5gBn9ci1fQpTwCiY6v).  

**Setup:**
- Large canvas or whiteboard divided into open space.  
- Sticky notes (physical or digital).  

**Process for Use:**
1. Place all brainstormed ideas on the board.  
2. Silent grouping: participants drag or move stickies into clusters by similarity.  
3. As a group, name clusters (e.g., “Onboarding,” “Speed,” “Delight”).  
4. Summarize insights per cluster (what opportunities are emerging?).  
5. Use dot-voting or prioritization frameworks (e.g., Impact vs. Effort) to highlight most promising themes.  

**Benefits:**
- Makes sense of chaos; patterns emerge.  
- Encourages collaborative sense-making.  
- Builds shared language and ownership around themes.  

---

### Decision Log

**Purpose:** Prevent brainstorms from fading into forgotten notes by capturing concrete outcomes [oai_citation:6‡14 tips on running a successful product design workshop.pdf](file-service://file-AoA11FpN3jXPajs1azPPUS).  

**Template Fields:**
- **Decision:** What was chosen (e.g., “Prototype onboarding flow A”).  
- **Problem:** Challenge this decision addresses.  
- **Options Considered:** Shortlist of ideas/themes discussed.  
- **Evidence:** Facts, insights, or hat outputs supporting choice.  
- **Risks Accepted:** Known downsides or trade-offs.  
- **Owner & Date:** Who will drive execution and by when.  
- **Revisit Trigger:** What would make us reconsider (e.g., “If <metric> fails in test”).  

**Process for Use:**
1. Fill live during wrap-up (facilitator + documenter).  
2. Share recap to all participants and stakeholders.  
3. Store in a visible, shared location (e.g., team Notion or project drive).  
4. Revisit in subsequent workshops or retros.  

**Benefits:**
- Bridges brainstorm → action.  
- Provides traceability of why/how decisions were made.  
- Helps new stakeholders understand context later.  

## Aftermath / Follow-ups
- Send recap: key ideas, clusters, votes, and decisions.
- Assign prototypes or POCs for top ideas.
- Track open questions (parking lot).
- Archive artifacts in shared drive/board.

## Best Practices & Pitfalls

### Do
- Set constraints (time, resources) to spark creativity.
- Alternate solo and group ideation.
- Document *all* ideas (no discarding).
- Use energizers to reset energy.
- Keep sessions short, focused, and frequent.

### Avoid
- Premature evaluation (kills creativity).
- Dominance by a few voices — facilitator must balance.
- Overuse of Black Hat (too much criticism early).
- Large, unfocused groups (>10) without structure.
