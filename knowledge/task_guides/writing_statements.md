# Guide for Writing Statements: User Stories, Job Stories, Hypotheses, How Might We, Key Insights

> **Executive Summary**  
> This guide provides practical frameworks and templates for writing effective statements during product discovery and design. It covers **User Stories, Job Stories, Hypotheses, How Might We questions, and Key Insights**, offering clear structures, examples, and best practices to align teams around user needs and problem-solving.

---

## Overview
- **Purpose:** Help teams articulate problems, needs, and opportunities clearly.
- **Scope:** Applicable in product management, UX, and design thinking processes.
- **Audience:** Designers, product managers, engineers, researchers.
- **Success Criteria:** Statements that are clear, actionable, empathetic, and aligned with user needs.

---

## User Story

**Structure**
"As a [user type], I want to [desire], so that I can [result]."

**Purpose**
- Frame the problem from the user’s perspective.
- Ensure anyone (even non-technical stakeholders) understands user needs.
- Aligns teams on user-centered goals.

**Example**
- *As a security officer, I want to keep my company data secure so I don’t get hacked.*

---

## Job Story

**Structure**
"When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]."

**Purpose**
- Focuses on **why** the user wants something, not just what.
- Provides flexibility for solutions by avoiding prescriptive user actions.
- Captures the **context + motivation + outcome**.

**Example**
- *When I am flying, I want to know which ingredients are in the food I’m given by the airline, so I can determine if I can eat it safely.*

---

## Hypothesis Statement

**Structure**
"We believe that [doing this/building this feature] for [these people/personas]
will achieve [this outcome]. We will know we are successful when [this measurable signal]."

**Purpose**
- Used to test assumptions before committing resources.
- Defines what success looks like with measurable criteria.

**Example**
- *We believe that introducing automatic security alerts for vulnerable accounts will reduce credential-based breaches by 30%. We’ll know we’re successful when the number of compromised accounts decreases over three months.*

## How Might We (HMW)

**Structure**
"How might we [solve the problem from a key insight/user story]?"

**Purpose**
- Frames opportunities as open-ended questions.  
- Encourages creative and collaborative brainstorming.  
- Keeps focus on the user problem rather than a single solution.  

**Example**
- *How might we keep our passengers with nut allergies safe while flying?*

---

## Key Insight

**Structure**
"[Persona/character] wants [action/situation] because [aim/need/outcome]
but [restriction/obstacle/friction]."

**Purpose**
- Synthesizes research findings into actionable guidance.  
- Provides a foundation for ideation and design.  
- Should be succinct, clear, and empathetic to avoid misdirection.  

**Example**
- *Alexa wants to eat the food given to her on the plane because she paid for it as part of her airfare, but she is afraid to eat it because it may contain allergens.*

## Best Practices & Pitfalls
### Do:
- Keep statements **user-centered**, not solution-centered.  
- Use **plain language** free of jargon.  
- Tie statements to **research evidence** when possible.  
- Ensure statements are **testable and actionable**.  

### Avoid:
- Writing statements that are **too vague** (e.g., “users want better security”).  
- Being **too prescriptive** about the solution.  
- Losing focus on the **user’s needs** by shifting toward business-only goals.

## Cross-Guide Linkage (Your Repo)

- **Critical Path Mapping** (`critical_path.md`): Essential for **User Story prioritization** - use critical path to identify which user stories represent the most important user experience flow; helps determine which statements to write first and which user journeys need the most detailed story development.
- **Journey Mapping** (`journey_mapping.md`): Reference for **Key Insight development** - provides user research context and touchpoint analysis that inform insight statement creation and problem identification.
- **User Personas** (`user_personas.md`): Apply during **User Story and Job Story creation** for accurate user type definition, motivation understanding, and context-appropriate statement framing.
- **MVP Definition** (`mvp_definition.md`): Use **Hypothesis Statements** from this guide during MVP scope definition to create testable assumptions about core features and validate solution approaches.
- **User Story Mapping** (`user_story_mapping.md`): Problem statements and How-Might-We questions from this guide define the scope and north star for story mapping sessions. Bring the problem statement into Phase 1 (Kickoff) and post it visibly for the duration of the workshop. HMW questions can also seed the initial Activity brainstorm during Phase 3.
