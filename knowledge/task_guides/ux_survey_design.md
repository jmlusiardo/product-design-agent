# UX Survey Design & Implementation Guide

## Overview

UX surveys are quick and relatively easy tools for collecting data about users and potential users. However, they carry risks—poor questioning can create surveys that mislead or provide unusable data. Surveys effectively gather feedback on live products, explore company USPs, conduct contextual inquiry, refine new features, and reduce risks of poor solutions.

> **Warning:** Surveys aim to uncover what many people think or feel, but often capture what people *think* they think or feel. People tend to exaggerate responses.

This guide provides a comprehensive framework for creating effective user feedback surveys using various question types, best practices, and proven methodologies.

## When to Use Surveys

### Surveys Are Good For Learning

- **Where users struggle** - Identify pain points and friction areas
- **User expectations** - Understand what users anticipate from your product
- **Feature helpfulness** - Assess the value and utility of specific features
- **User perception/view** - Gather insights about brand and product perception

### Surveys Should NOT Be Used For

- **How users behave** - Use User Interviews instead
- **What users actually do** - Use User Interviews instead  
- **Product usability testing** - Use Usability Testing instead
- **Specific user needs** - Use User Interviews instead

---

## Survey Planning & Setup

### Define Clear Goals

Before writing questions, establish crystal-clear knowledge of what you're trying to learn about users. Goals can emerge from:

- Stakeholder meetings identifying feature-user habit alignment
- Quantitative insights (e.g., high customer drop-off rates at payment)
- Specific product hypothesis validation

**Key Question:** How will the end results help us make decisions?

### Calculate Sample Size

Determine statistically representative sample sizes based on:
- Total user population
- Desired confidence level
- Acceptable margin of error
- Expected response rate

### Set Up Screening

Implement screener questions to ensure you reach your target personas:
- Filter out users who don't match your target audience
- Prevent resource waste on irrelevant feedback
- Improve data quality by targeting real users

## Question Types & Examples

### 1. Open-Ended Questions

**Definition:** Allow wide-ranging responses with detailed answers in users' own words.

**Best Practices:**
- Use as follow-ups to quantitative questions (like NPS scores)
- Keep prompts clear but not leading
- Allow sufficient response space

**Examples:**
- "Is there anything you feel our product could do better?"
- "What is the one thing you wish this product could do that it doesn't already do?"
- "How would you describe our product in 3 words?"

### 2. Yes/No Questions

**Definition:** Simple binary response questions.

**Best Practices:**
- Excellent for screening and filtering
- Keep questions unambiguous
- Use for qualifying respondents

**Examples:**
- "Have you used any products similar to ours?"
- "Based on your recent experiences, are you satisfied with our customer service?"

### 3. Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)

**Definition:** Present 3+ predetermined answer options.

**Best Practices:**
- Gather behavioral and attitudinal information
- Include "Other (please specify)" option
- Keep option lists manageable

**Examples:**
- "What kind of work do you do?" (with role options)
- "How will you primarily use [product name]?"

### 4. Checkbox Questions

**Definition:** Allow multiple selections from a list.

**Best Practices:**
- Determine sets of user characteristics
- Clear instructions about multiple selections
- Include "Other; please specify" option

**Examples:**
- "Which features do you find most useful? Select all that apply."
- "Choose your top 3 goals with [product name]."

### 5. Rating Questions

**Definition:** Numeric scale responses (typically 1-5 or 1-10).

**Best Practices:**
- Use 1-10 scale for NPS surveys
- Use 1-5 scale for general satisfaction
- Label scale endpoints clearly

**Examples:**
- "On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend ABC Software to colleagues?"
- "Rate your recent customer service experience (1-5 scale)."

### 6. Likert Scale Questions

**Definition:** 5 or 7-point scales measuring opinions symmetrically around a median.

**Response Options:**
- Strongly disagree → Strongly agree
- Very dissatisfied → Very satisfied  
- Sad face → Happy face emojis

**Examples:**
- "How satisfied are you with our product?"
- "How would you rate the usefulness of our product?"

### 7. Rank Order Questions

**Definition:** Order answer choices by preference or priority.

**Best Practices:**
- Keep lists short to avoid fatigue
- Split long lists into categories
- Use for feature prioritization

**Examples:**
- "Please rank these features by importance"
- "Rank these goals by your priority"

### 8. Matrix Survey Questions

**Definition:** Multiple questions with same response options in grid format.

**Best Practices:**
- Saves time by not repeating options
- Use for related question series
- Keep matrix size reasonable

**Examples:**
- "Rate our customer service on each criterion"
- "Rate these products by usefulness"

### 9. Demographic Questions

**Definition:** Gather background characteristics and demographic data.

**Best Practices:**
- Place at survey end unless needed for screening
- Keep sensitive questions optional
- Be mindful of privacy concerns

**Examples:**
- "What role best describes you?"
- "In which industry is your business?"

## Survey Design Best Practices

### Question Design Principles

- **Use simple language** - Avoid jargon and technical terminology
- **Ask neutral questions** - Avoid leading or biased phrasing
- **One concept per question** - Don't mix multiple topics
- **Keep questions relevant** - Focus on actionable insights
- **Provide balanced options** - Don't bias toward positive responses

### Language & Clarity Guidelines

- **Easy and simple questions** - Clear language, meaning, and context
- **Consider localization** - Add local language support for different regions
- **Avoid double-barreled questions** - Don't ask two things in one question
- **Question examples:**
  - Good: "What do you think of this feature?"
  - Poor: "Why do you like this feature?" (assumes they like it)

### Survey Structure & Organization

- **Start with easy questions** - Build momentum before complex topics
- **Group related questions** - Organize by theme or topic
- **End with light questions** - Finish on a positive note
- **Use conditional logic** - Show relevant questions only
- **Design for conditionality** - Skip irrelevant questions based on previous answers

## Testing & Iteration Process

### Pilot Testing

**Process:**
1. Select small group matching your personas
2. Test with colleagues for comprehension
3. Conduct moderated tests to identify problems
4. Notice completion time for each participant
5. Gather feedback on language, length, and meaning

**Key Observations:**
- Are words and context clear to users?
- What hardships do users face while completing?
- How long does completion take?

### Iteration Guidelines

**After pilot testing:**
1. Make language adjustments based on feedback
2. Adjust survey length if completion time is excessive
3. Clarify confusing questions or terminology
4. Finalize draft incorporating all learnings
