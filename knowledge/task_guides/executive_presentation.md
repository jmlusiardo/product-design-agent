# Executive Presentations That Drive Decisions: SCQA, Alignment & Executive Habits

> **Executive Summary** — Executives consume information in distinct, practiced ways. To be heard and drive decisions, anchor your presentation in a concise written core (SCQA), align early (nemawashi), and use the meeting to extract perspective rather than “win.” Set a flexible agenda, obsess over the opening paragraph, and always bring a proposed answer. Avoid fighting feedback, hiding problems, or giving academic-style talks; send an early draft to an attending executive and iterate with their input.

## Overview & Objectives
- **Purpose:** Equip presenters to influence executive decisions by matching executive information habits, using structured writing, and aligning ahead of the meeting.
- **Scope:** Planning conversations, status updates, and misalignment resolution with executive audiences.
- **Audience:** ICs, tech leads, managers, and staff-plus leaders preparing executive readouts or proposals.
- **Success Criteria / KPIs:**
  - Clear executive perspective captured and reflected in next iteration.
  - Decision or directional alignment achieved (or crisp follow-ups defined).
  - Feedback volume/quality increases (signals trust and engagement).
  - Reduced surprise in the room due to strong pre-alignment.

## Preparation
- **Clarify why you’re meeting:**
  - Are you **planning**, **reporting status**, or **resolving misalignment**?
  - Your goal is to **extract executive perspective** and align with their priorities.
- **Understand executive “preprocessing”:**
  - Executives are often exceptional at **one way of consuming information**.
  - Some pattern-match through rapid questions; others discount claims not tied to **specific data**.
- **Write first; then present:**
  - Create a **structured document**; lead with the **SCQA** opening paragraph.
  - Keep the answer visible early; let the rest support it.
- **Pre-align (nemawashi):**
  - Circulate the draft with peers and stakeholders **before** the meeting.
  - Invite an attending executive to review an **early draft** and ask what to change.
- **Set agenda, but prioritize discussion:**
  - A great exec meeting is defined by **engaged discussion**, not rigid agenda completion.
- **Preparation Checklist**
  - - [ ] Meeting purpose tagged: planning / status / misalignment.
  - - [ ] SCQA opening drafted; answer stated clearly.
  - - [ ] Executive’s info habits noted (pattern-matching vs. data-first).
  - - [ ] Critical data linked or summarized; appendix ready if needed.
  - - [ ] Peer/stakeholder feedback incorporated (nemawashi).
  - - [ ] Early draft shared with an attending executive for change requests.
  - - [ ] Agenda prepared with flexible timing and key decisions/questions.
  - - [ ] Risks/issues explicitly surfaced (no surprises).
  - - [ ] Proposed recommendation included (never bring only a problem).

## Main Flow / Process
### 1) Opening
- Deliver the **SCQA** opening paragraph aloud or as a one-pager.
- State the **answer/recommendation** and **why now**; confirm the decision you’re seeking.

### 2) Discussion & Perspective Extraction
- Invite questions immediately; **adapt to the executive’s style**:
  - Pattern-matching execs: answer rapid probes to help them locate analogs.
  - Data-first execs: connect claims to **specific datasets** and metrics.
- Treat feedback as valuable signal; **do not fight it** in the room.
- If you disagree with a call, inject **1–2 relevant data points**—then let it go.

### 3) Decision / Direction
- Present your **proposed answer** (required for alignment).
- Surface constraints and tradeoffs explicitly; avoid hiding issues.

### 4) Wrap-Up
- Summarize **what you heard** (perspective, constraints, direction).
- Confirm areas of **alignment/misalignment** and the few **follow-ups** (data, experiments, revisions).
- Agree on the **next iteration** of the document or plan.

## Templates / Canvases / Frameworks
### SCQA Opening (fill-in template)
- **Situation:** Context that matters now.  
  _Example stub:_ “We expanded headcount last year to accelerate feature delivery…”
- **Complication:** Why the status quo is problematic.  
  _Stub:_ “…but shipped fewer features despite the larger team.”
- **Question:** The pivotal decision to address.  
  _Stub:_ “Should we continue doubling headcount this year?”
- **Answer:** Your recommendation, upfront.  
  _Stub:_ “Pause hiring for six months; focus on team cohesion; reassess afterward.”

### Minto Pyramid Principle (outline)
- Group arguments supporting your **Answer** into **three** top-level points.
- Under each, include up to **three sub-arguments**; each parent summarizes its children.
- Order arguments **by importance**; keep the structure visible.
- Use Pyramid for the full doc; use **SCQA** for the opening.

### Pre-Alignment (Nemawashi) Mini-Playbook
1. Circulate the draft to peers & adjacent stakeholders for candid edits.
2. Identify an attending executive; send an **early** version asking “What should I change?”
3. Incorporate feedback; capture deltas and unresolved questions in an appendix.
4. Enter the meeting ready to **listen and adapt**, not to defend slides.

## Aftermath / Follow-Ups
- Send a concise **post-read**: what changed, what you heard, decision/direction, and next steps.
- Provide any **additional data** requested; revise the document accordingly.
- Where disagreement remains, plan a **later revisit** with new evidence rather than relitigating immediately.
- Reflect on executive preferences observed; update your presenter notes for next time.

## Best Practices & Pitfalls
- **Do**
  - Lead with **SCQA**; obsess over the opening paragraph.
  - Match the executive’s **information consumption** style.
  - Use the meeting to **extract perspective**; arrive with a proposed answer.
  - Pre-align through **nemawashi**; share early drafts with an attending exec.
  - Keep the agenda flexible to enable **engaged discussion**.
- **Avoid**
  - **Fighting feedback** in the room.
  - **Evading responsibility** or hiding problems.
  - **Presenting a question without an answer**.
  - **Academic-style** presentations that back-load the conclusion.
  - **Fixating** on a single outcome; most decisions are revisited over time.

## Tools & Resources
- **Structured document over slides**; SCQA front-loads clarity.
- **Appendix-ready data** for data-first executives; clear linkage from claims to sources.
- **Pyramid Principle** as a full-document scaffold when presentations feel hard to follow.
- **Nemawashi** practices to reduce surprises and build alignment pre-meeting.

## FAQ / Quick Answers
- **Q:** What if the meeting derails into questions?  
  **A:** That can be productive—pattern-matching executives probe to locate context. Answer directly; keep your **Answer** visible and tie back to it.
- **Q:** How do I handle a decision I disagree with?  
  **A:** Offer **one or two** crucial data points, then let it go and follow up later with a revised doc.
- **Q:** Should I wait to present until my data appendix is perfect?  
  **A:** No—lead with SCQA and your answer; use appendices to satisfy data-first preferences and follow-ups.
- **Q:** How do I avoid surprises?  
  **A:** **Pre-align** via stakeholder reviews and send an **early draft** to an attending executive.
