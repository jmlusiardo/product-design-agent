# Contextual Inquiries: Comprehensive Field Research Guide

> **Executive Summary** — Contextual inquiries combine interviews with observations in users' natural work environments. This guide covers the complete methodology from planning through analysis, including the four core principles (Context, Partnership, Interpretation, Focus), participant recruitment, fieldwork execution, note-taking strategies, and systematic analysis through coding and affinity diagramming. The approach is ideal for understanding work processes, daily routines, and product usage patterns.

## Overview & Objectives

**Purpose:** Enable comprehensive understanding of users' work processes, daily routines, and product interactions through direct observation and collaborative interpretation in natural settings.

**Scope:** Complete contextual inquiry methodology including planning, execution, documentation, and analysis phases for both agile and formal approaches.

**Audience:** UX researchers, product designers, product managers, and development team members conducting user research.

**Success Criteria:**
- Rich insights into user workflows, pain points, and motivations captured
- Collaborative understanding developed between researchers and users
- Observable behaviors documented alongside stated preferences
- Research findings prepared for systematic analysis through affinity diagramming

## Prerequisites

### Required Skills
- Interview facilitation and active listening capabilities
- Observational research techniques and ethnographic methods
- Note-taking and documentation systems
- Basic knowledge of qualitative research methods

### Resources Needed
- Access to target users in their natural work environments
- Recording equipment (audio preferred over video)
- Note-taking materials (digital device with quiet keyboard or paper)
- Consent forms and ethics approval
- Transportation and scheduling coordination

### Pre-Research Setup
- Research questions defined and focused on specific domain
- Participant recruitment completed (10-16 users recommended)
- Internal stakeholder alignment on objectives and scope
- Equipment testing and backup plans prepared

## Quickstart

**For immediate implementation:**

1. **Define Focus Domain** (30 minutes)
   - Identify specific work area or process to study
   - Frame 2-3 research questions about tasks, goals, and variations
   - Set boundaries on scope (not too narrow, not too broad)

2. **Recruit Participants** (1-2 weeks)
   - Target 10-12 users, schedule 16 to account for cancellations
   - Schedule 1.5-2 hour sessions in natural work environments
   - Confirm written consent for observation and recording

3. **Prepare Materials** (1 day)
   - Note-taking template with participant codes
   - Recording equipment with backup batteries
   - Research questions and starter prompts
   - Consent forms and compensation materials

4. **Execute Sessions** (2-3 weeks)
   - Follow master-apprentice relationship model
   - Observe first, discuss second, interpret collaboratively
   - Focus on single concepts per note, use first person
   - Take action photos with consent

## Core Principles

### 1. Context
Interviews are conducted in natural settings where activities occur. Watch users perform their actual tasks using real artifacts and discuss relevant past events that impact current work patterns.

**Implementation:**
- Schedule sessions in actual work locations
- Minimize artificial or lab-like conditions
- Allow interruptions and natural workflow patterns
- Document physical environment and available tools

### 2. Partnership  
User and researcher collaborate to understand the user's work. Alternate between observing work activities and discussing actions, motivations, and decisions in real-time.

**Implementation:**
- Establish master-apprentice relationship (user teaches researcher)
- Encourage users to demonstrate rather than just explain
- Ask clarifying questions during natural breaks in work
- Validate interpretations with users throughout session

### 3. Interpretation
Share interpretations and insights with users during interviews, especially when significant reinterpretation occurs or insights don't directly follow from observations.

**Implementation:**
- Voice your understanding back to users for confirmation
- Identify patterns and themes collaboratively
- Correct misunderstandings immediately
- Document user's expanded or corrected explanations

### 4. Focus
Steer interactions toward topics relevant to the team's scope. Significant steering may be needed to maintain productive focus while respecting natural work flow.

**Implementation:**
- Redirect gently when conversations drift off-topic
- Use prepared research questions as guideposts
- Balance focus with respect for user's natural priorities
- Document unexpected but potentially valuable tangents

## Main Procedure

### Phase 1: Planning & Research Questions

**Research Question Development**
Frame "big picture" questions that guide the entire study:

1. **Tasks and Goals:** What are people doing, what's important about their work, what are their goals, problems, high and low points?

2. **Variation Analysis:** How much variation exists in problem-solving approaches? If highly context-sensitive, increase participant count.

3. **Focus Definition:** Which part of the problem domain requires investigation? Should be specific enough for actionable insights but broad enough for comprehensive understanding.

**Participant Planning**
- Recruit 10-12 users minimum, up to 16 for complex domains
- Schedule 1.5-2 hours per session
- Plan for 10-20% rebooking rate due to cancellations
- Prefer participants with vested interest in improvement areas

### Phase 2: Fieldwork Execution

**Session Introduction**
- Thank participants for involvement
- Explain process emphasizing no wrong answers
- Assure anonymity and authentic behavior focus
- Obtain consent with withdrawal rights explained
- Outline research focus area
- Establish master-apprentice relationship

**Session Management**
- Observe user activity while taking detailed notes
- Ask clarifying questions using semi-structured approach
- Confirm notes conversationally when necessary
- Maintain focus through gentle redirection
- Walk through tasks mentally if direct observation impossible

**Session Close**
- Thank participant and acknowledge contribution value
- Resolve any compensation arrangements
- Schedule follow-up if needed for complex domains

### Phase 3: Documentation & Note-Taking

**Note-Taking Best Practices**
- Focus on single concept or observation per note
- Write in first person ("I always..." format)
- Identify participants using anonymous codes
- Check significant rewordings with participants
- Add timestamps for audio/video cross-reference
- Take action photos with consent

**Recording Guidelines**
- **Audio:** Generally more effective and less intrusive than video
- **Video:** Use sparingly due to bias potential (1 in 7 people affected)
- Consider participant permission and anonymity requirements
- Maintain backup recording methods

**Documentation Structure**
```markdown
T05: Keeps prices of hotel and car options in paper notebook.
Takes several weeks to get the best price.
T05: Knows prices change over time, so searches at different
times of day and days of the week looking for best deal.
T05: Couldn't get both cheapest airfare and best car rental
prices—cheaper flights meant expensive car return locations.
```

### Phase 4: Analysis & Coding

**Agile Contextual Inquiries**
- All notes go directly to affinity diagramming
- Coding used only to assess data completeness
- More responsibility on note-takers for quality
- Faster turnaround for simple problem domains

**Formal Contextual Inquiries** 
- Interpretation sessions prior to affinity diagramming
- More time-intensive but produces higher quality data
- Recommended for complex problem domains
- Involves detailed category development and validation

**Coding Process**
- Review interview notes and assign categories
- Categories derive from interviews, not pre-established frameworks
- Ask: "Are we covering all aspects needed?"
- Identify holes in data and areas for further exploration
- Continue until reaching saturated categories (no new themes)

### Phase 5: Interpretation Sessions (Formal CI)

**Session Structure** (within 48 hours of interviews)
- Include stakeholders, up to 8 participants maximum
- Interviewer narrates single interview events
- Team listens, asks questions, draws models, records insights
- Develop shared understanding of user behaviors
- May generate additional affinity notes

**Outcomes**
- Enhanced interpretation of interview data
- Shared team understanding of user context
- Additional design ideas and insights captured
- Preparation for systematic affinity diagramming

## Analysis & Results

### Affinity Diagramming Integration
Following contextual inquiry fieldwork, conduct comprehensive affinity diagramming sessions to:
- Group related concepts and identify key themes
- Simulate design ideas addressing problems and motivations
- Distill interesting behaviors for persona development
- Familiarize stakeholders with user research insights

*Cross-reference: See `affinity_diagramming.md` for complete process*

### Triangulation & Validation
- Combine contextual inquiry findings with other research methods
- Use market research, surveys, and usability testing to confirm conclusions
- Position findings as hypotheses for further validation
- Integrate insights with quantitative data when available

### Time and Resource Requirements

**Preparation Phase:**
- Simple studies: 0.5-2 days preparation
- Complex studies: Up to 1 week preparation

**Per Interview:**
- 1.5-2 hours fieldwork session
- 0.5-1 hour coding (Agile CI)
- 1.5-2 hours interpretation meeting per team member (Formal CI)
- 0.5-1 hour affinity diagramming preparation

**Total Resource Investment:**
- Minimum: 10 person-days (6 interviews, 6 participants, simple domain)
- Maximum: 36 person-days (12 interviews, 6 participants, complex domain)

## Examples & Applications

### Research Context Examples
- **Stakeholder meetings:** Better understand opportunities and constraints
- **Post-contextual inquiries:** Organize research notes systematically
- **UX workshops:** Have participants categorize information collaboratively
- **Product planning:** Gain consensus on requirements and strategic direction

### Note-Taking Examples
```markdown
Observation: "I use a minimal shopping list"
Context: "If it's something I don't buy every week, I scribble
it on a list on the fridge"
Behavior: "Regular items I buy from memory—going up and down
the aisles"
Preference: "I always do main shopping at Tesco and top-up
shopping at Waitrose as it's convenient"
```

### User Profile Examples
```markdown
June: Full-time mother, early 30's. Two children, now at
college. Current online shopper.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Challenges

**Access and Scheduling Issues**
- Plan for 10-20% cancellation/rescheduling rate
- Have backup participants identified
- Build buffer time into research timeline
- Consider virtual alternatives when on-site access impossible

**Participant Engagement**
- Some participants may need significant steering to stay focused
- Balance respect for natural workflow with research objectives
- Use master-apprentice framing to encourage active demonstration
- Address participant concerns about being judged or evaluated

**Data Quality Concerns**
- Ensure note-takers can keep up with observation and discussion
- Validate significant interpretations with participants during session
- Use multiple team members for complex domains
- Plan interpretation sessions for critical insights

### When NOT to Use Contextual Inquiries

**Alternative Methods Preferred:**
- **Early detailed design:** Paper prototyping more suitable
- **Existing solution evaluation:** Usability testing provides better task focus
- **Simple problem solving:** Prototyping + usability testing more efficient  
- **Quantitative studies:** Surveys and analytics more appropriate

**Scope Limitations:**
- Contextual inquiry operates at moderately high level
- Task-level detail emerges but isn't the primary focus
- Not suitable for minute interaction analysis

## FAQ

**Q: How many participants do I need?**
A: Recruit 10-12 users minimum, up to 16 for complex domains. Plan for 10-20% cancellation rate, so schedule accordingly.

**Q: Should I use video or audio recording?**
A: Audio recording is generally more effective and less intrusive. Video can bias 1 in 7 participants toward unnatural behavior.

**Q: What if I can't observe tasks directly?**
A: Have participants walk you through tasks mentally, use artifacts and past examples, and focus on understanding workflow patterns and decision-making processes.

**Q: How do I handle interruptions during sessions?**
A: Allow natural interruptions as they provide authentic context. Document how users manage competing priorities and workflow disruptions.

**Q: What's the difference between Agile and Formal CI?**
A: Agile CI sends notes directly to affinity diagramming with minimal coding. Formal CI includes interpretation sessions before affinity diagramming, taking more time but producing richer analysis for complex domains.
