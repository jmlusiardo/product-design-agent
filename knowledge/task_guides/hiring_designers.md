# Guide to Building and Hiring Design Teams

> **Executive Summary** â€” This guide provides a structured framework for hiring designers, from defining team needs through evaluation criteria to interview best practices. It combines Joel Califa's three-phase hiring methodology with practical templates, red flags to watch for, and lessons from Figma's design team growth. The focus is on creating clear requirements, reducing bias, and building diverse, skilled teams aligned with company values.

## Overview & Objectives

- **Purpose:** Help design leaders and hiring managers build effective design teams through structured, thoughtful hiring processes
- **Scope:** Covers skills evaluation, interview planning, cultural assessment, and team composition strategies
- **Audience:** Design managers, heads of design, recruiters, and startup founders building design teams
- **Success Criteria:**
  - Clear role definitions and expectations
  - Consistent evaluation criteria across interviewers
  - Reduced hiring bias through structured assessment
  - Teams with complementary skills and diverse perspectives

## Core Framework: The Three-Phase Hiring Process

### Phase 1: Learn
- Research every relevant job description in your domain
- Interview other design leaders about their team-building experiences
- Build comprehensive understanding of potentially valuable skills and traits
- Study successful design teams in similar contexts

### Phase 2: Analyze
- Create comprehensive list of all possible skills
- Filter to skills the company genuinely needs
- Narrow to skills the design team should own
- Define baseline requirements every designer must have
- Distinguish between "must-haves" and "nice-to-haves"

### Phase 3: Evolve
- Regularly reassess team gaps as needs change
- Identify emerging skill requirements
- Prioritize internal growth when possible
- Adjust requirements based on market conditions and company evolution

## Preparation: Skills Evaluation Exercise

### Running the Team Exercise
1. **Independent brainstorming:** Each team member lists desired skills/traits
2. **Collaborative consolidation:** Merge lists in shared document (Figma/Miro)
3. **Categorization:** Group into:
   - Baseline requirements (all designers need)
   - Supplementary skills (some team members need)
   - Company-specific needs
   - Cultural fit attributes

### Core Design Skills to Evaluate

- Interaction design

**Process & Collaboration**
- Design process maturity
- Ability to work cross-functionally
- Communication skills
- Facilitation abilities
- Documentation practices

**Strategic Thinking**

## Cultural Assessment Framework

### Company Values Alignment
Map your company's core values to behavioral indicators:

- **Be Inclusive:** Collaboration, empathy, diverse perspectives
- **Have Fun:** Creativity, team dynamics, positive energy

### Integration with Evaluation Tools

- Company is public about values and beliefs
- Well-defined design career ladder exists
- Regular 1:1 meetings and feedback sessions
- Commitment to user research and UX
- Inclusive, diverse, and supportive environment

### ðŸ”´ Red Flags (Warning Signs)
- Unclear role expectations
- No design representation in leadership
- Design treated as service function only
- High turnover in design team
- No budget for research or testing
- Designers doing primarily non-design work
- Toxic team dynamics or poor morale

## Structured Interview Process

### Pre-Interview Setup
- Define specific skills to assess per interview round
- Assign clear focus areas to each interviewer
- Create standardized rubrics for evaluation
- Prepare role-specific design challenges

### Interview Components

**Portfolio Review**
- Focus on process, not just outcomes
- Ask about constraints and trade-offs
- Understand collaboration dynamics
- Evaluate problem-solving approach

**Design Challenge**
- Keep scope reasonable (2-3 hours max)
- Provide clear constraints and context
- Evaluate thinking process over polish
- Allow for questions and clarification

**Cultural Fit Assessment**
- Use behavioral questions tied to values
- Ask for specific examples
- Look for self-awareness and growth mindset
- Evaluate collaboration style

**Technical Skills Evaluation**
- Assess relevant tools and methods

- Evaluate learning agility
- Check systems thinking ability

## Reducing Bias in Hiring

### Structured Evaluation Methods
- Use consistent criteria across all candidates

- Implement scoring rubrics before interviews
- Require written feedback before group discussion

### Diversity and Inclusion Practices
- Embed recruiters in design team activities
- Source from diverse talent pools
- Remove identifying information in initial reviews
- Include diverse interview panels

## Team Composition Strategy

### Building Complementary Skills
- Map current team capabilities
- Identify critical gaps
- Balance specialists and generalists
- Consider career growth trajectories

### Role Differentiation Examples

**Product Designer Requirements:**
- Strong craft and visual design
- Product thinking and user empathy
- Prototyping and interaction design
- Cross-functional collaboration

**Growth Designer Requirements:**
- Data analysis and experimentation
- Conversion optimization
- A/B testing methodology
- Metrics-driven mindset

**Design System Designer:**
