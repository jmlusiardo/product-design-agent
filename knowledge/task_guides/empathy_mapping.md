# Empathy Mapping: Understanding Users Through Collaborative Visualization

> **Executive Summary** — Empathy maps are collaborative visualization tools that help teams develop deep, shared understanding of users by capturing what they say, think, do, and feel. This guide covers the complete process from planning to implementation, including Dave Gray's updated canvas framework, team facilitation techniques, and integration with personas and journey mapping. Ideal for building user empathy, synthesizing research insights, and aligning teams around user needs.

## Overview & Objectives

- **Purpose:** Create shared understanding of user attitudes, behaviors, and motivations through collaborative mapping exercises
- **Scope:** Individual user empathy maps, aggregated user segment maps, and team alignment workshops  
- **Audience:** UX researchers, designers, product managers, and cross-functional teams
- **Success Criteria:**
  - Teams demonstrate improved empathy and user understanding
  - User insights inform design and product decisions
  - Gaps in user knowledge are identified and addressed
  - Alignment achieved across stakeholders on user needs

## Prerequisites

### Required Knowledge
- Basic understanding of user research principles
- Familiarity with qualitative research methods
- Workshop facilitation experience (for team sessions)

### Required Materials
- User research data (interviews, observations, surveys)
- Empathy map canvas template (see Templates section)
- Sticky notes and markers (for physical workshops)
- Digital collaboration tool (for remote sessions)

### Preparation Checklist
- [ ] Define scope and target user/persona
- [ ] Gather relevant research inputs
- [ ] Select appropriate empathy map format
- [ ] Prepare workshop materials and space
- [ ] Align stakeholders on session goals

## Quickstart

### 5-Minute Setup
1. **Choose your focus:** Individual user or user segment
2. **Gather research:** User interviews, observations, or feedback
3. **Set up canvas:** Use Dave Gray's updated template with 6 sections
4. **Start with observable:** Begin with "Says" and "Does" quadrants
5. **Infer internal states:** Move to "Thinks" and "Feels" in the center

### Essential Questions to Answer
- Who specifically are we empathizing with?
- What goal are they trying to accomplish?
- What do they say and do that we can observe?
- What might they think and feel that we must infer?

## Main Process

### Phase 1: Setup and Scoping (15 minutes)

#### Define Your Subject and Goal
Start with the GOAL section of the empathy map canvas:
- **WHO:** Define the specific user or persona you're mapping
- **GOAL:** Identify something they need to DO (frame as observable behavior)
- **Context:** Establish the situation or environment

Example: "Sarah, a marketing manager, needs to create a monthly performance report for her team."

#### Choose Map Type
- **Individual Map:** Based on single user interview or diary study
- **Aggregated Map:** Synthesizes multiple users with similar behaviors
- **Collaborative Map:** Team workshop to align on user understanding

### Phase 2: Observable Phenomena (30 minutes)

Work clockwise around the canvas, focusing on what can be directly observed:

#### 1. What Do They SEE?
- Environment and immediate surroundings
- Friends, colleagues, and influencers
- Market offerings and competitors
- What they watch and read

*Example: "Sees conflicting data in multiple dashboards, colleagues struggling with similar reporting tasks"*

#### 2. What Do They SAY?
- Direct quotes from research (verbatim preferred)
- Public statements and communications
- What they tell others about the experience

*Use exact quotes when possible: "I wish I could just click one button and have everything I need"*

#### 3. What Do They DO?
- Observable actions and behaviors
- Physical and digital interactions
- Workarounds and coping mechanisms
- Decision-making patterns

*Example: "Switches between 5 different tools, manually copies data into spreadsheets, double-checks numbers three times"*

#### 4. What Do They HEAR?
- Feedback from others (bosses, friends, influencers)
- Media and information sources
- Second-hand information and opinions
- Organizational messages

*Example: "Boss emphasizes accuracy over speed, colleagues complain about data inconsistencies"*

### Phase 3: Internal States (20 minutes)

After completing the observable quadrants, focus on the user's internal experience:

#### Think and Feel (Center of Map)

**PAINS (Frustrations and Anxieties):**
- Fears and worries
- Obstacles and challenges  
- What keeps them up at night
- Negative emotions

*Example: "Worried about making errors, frustrated by repetitive work, anxious about meeting deadlines"*

**GAINS (Wants, Needs, and Dreams):**
- Desires and aspirations
- Success measures
- What good looks like
- Positive outcomes

*Example: "Wants to focus on analysis rather than data collection, dreams of automated reporting, needs stakeholder confidence"*

### Phase 4: Synthesis and Validation (15 minutes)

#### Look for Patterns and Contradictions
- Identify themes across quadrants
- Note conflicting information
- Highlight outliers and anomalies
- Document gaps in understanding

#### Validate Insights
- Check against other research sources
- Verify with additional team members
- Test assumptions with users when possible
- Update map based on new information

## Templates and Canvases

### Dave Gray's Updated Empathy Map Canvas
The recommended canvas includes six numbered sections:
1. WHO are we empathizing with? / GOAL: What do they need to DO?
2. What do they SEE? (Environment, friends, market offers)
3. What do they SAY? (Public statements, quotes)
4. What do they DO? (Behaviors, actions)
5. What do they HEAR? (Influencers, friends, colleagues)
6. What do they THINK and FEEL? (Pains and Gains)

### Facilitation Template

**Session Structure (90 minutes total):**
- Introduction and goal setting (10 min)
- Individual sticky note generation (20 min)
- Collaborative mapping (40 min)
- Clustering and synthesis (15 min)
- Next steps and documentation (5 min)

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-User Aggregation
When creating empathy maps for user segments:
1. Complete individual maps for 3-5 representative users
2. Identify common themes and patterns
3. Create aggregated map representing the segment
4. Note variations and edge cases
5. Use as input for persona development

### Integration with Other Methods
- **Pre-Personas:** Use empathy maps to gather insights before creating detailed personas
- **Journey Mapping:** Reference empathy map insights when mapping user journeys
- **Problem Definition:** Extract pain points for problem statement creation
- **Feature Prioritization:** Use gains and pains to prioritize development efforts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Team focuses only on what users say, ignoring behavior
**Solution:** Emphasize the importance of observing actions. Ask "What did they actually do?" for each statement.

**Issue:** Difficulty inferring thoughts and feelings
**Solution:** Look for behavioral cues, emotional language, and hesitations in research. Ask "Why might they behave this way?"

**Issue:** Map becomes too generic or obvious
**Solution:** Use specific quotes and concrete examples. Avoid assumptions. Return to source research for details.

**Issue:** Team gets stuck on one quadrant
**Solution:** Set time limits for each section. Move forward even if incomplete—you can always return.

**Issue:** Conflicting interpretations of user data
**Solution:** Document different perspectives. Use additional research to resolve conflicts. Flag areas needing validation.

### Quality Assurance
- Each quadrant should contain specific, actionable insights
- Thoughts and feelings should be inferred from observable data
- Map should reveal gaps in current knowledge
- Insights should feel authentic and human

## Examples

### Individual User Example: E-commerce Shopper

**Goal:** Jamie needs to buy a birthday gift for her sister

**Says:** "I want something unique but not too expensive" / "I don't have time to go to stores"
**Thinks/Feels:** PAINS: Worried about wrong choice, frustrated by too many options / GAINS: Wants sister to feel special, needs convenient shopping
**Does:** Browses multiple sites, reads reviews, compares prices, abandons carts
**Hears:** Sister mentions interests, friends recommend brands, ads promote sales

### Team Workshop Example: B2B Software Users

**Context:** Product team mapping IT administrator personas
**Process:** 6-person workshop using individual research summaries from 8 user interviews
**Output:** Aggregated empathy map identifying key pain points around security compliance and time constraints
**Impact:** Shifted product roadmap to prioritize automation features over manual configuration options

## FAQ

### How long should an empathy mapping session take?
Individual mapping: 30-60 minutes. Team workshop: 90-120 minutes. Complex aggregated maps: 2-3 hours across multiple sessions.

### How many users should inform an empathy map?
Individual maps: 1 user. Segment maps: 3-5 similar users minimum. More complex segments may require 8-10 users for reliable patterns.

### When should we update empathy maps?
Update when new research emerges, user behaviors shift, or maps feel stale. Review quarterly for active products, annually for stable segments.

### Can empathy maps replace personas?
No. Empathy maps are a tool for gathering and organizing insights. Personas are complete user archetypes that may use empathy map insights as input.

### How detailed should empathy maps be?
Detailed enough to drive decisions but not so complex they become unwieldy. Focus on insights that directly impact design and product choices.

### What if we don't have direct user research?
Use proxy research methods: analytics data, customer support insights, sales feedback. See the "UX Research Without Users" guide for alternative approaches.
