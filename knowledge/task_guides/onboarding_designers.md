# Assisting Designers Onboarding to a New Company

> **Executive Summary** — This guide packages proven 30/60/90 onboarding practices for product designers into checklists, meeting cadences, and templates. It centers on **People–Product–Process** discovery, rapid relationship-building, and early, co-created goals that move a new hire toward the **break‑even point** (delivering as much value as they consume). Use the prep lists for Day 1 and Weeks 1–12, the stakeholder‑map and SMART goal templates, and the follow‑ups to keep momentum. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
