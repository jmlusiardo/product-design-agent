# Mental Modeling: Understanding User Assumptions and System Expectations

## Executive Summary

Mental modeling is a foundational UX research methodology that uncovers how users think systems should work before they fully understand them. This technique bridges the gap between initial research and detailed design by mapping user assumptions, daily task patterns, and conceptual expectations. Mental modeling workshops reveal the disconnect between user mental models and actual system behavior, providing critical insights for feature prioritization and interaction design.

**Key outcomes:** User assumption inventory, task-gap-opportunity matrix, feature ideation foundation, stakeholder alignment on user expectations.

## Complete Methodology

### Phase 1: Foundation and Context Setting (15 minutes)

#### UX Principles Framework Introduction
Before diving into user tasks, establish shared understanding of six key UX principles that influence mental models:

**Core UX Principles Affecting Mental Models:**
- **Affordances:** How objects/systems signal their intended use
- **Simplicity:** Level of transparency and ease of understanding
- **Familiarity:** Leveraging existing patterns and user knowledge
- **Availability:** Reducing memory load through clear functionality visibility
- **Flexibility:** Multiple pathways to accomplish goals
- **Feedback:** Continuous, clear system response to user actions

#### Mental Model Progression Understanding
Help participants understand the three-stage progression:
1. **Mental Models:** User's initial assumptions about how system works
2. **Conceptual Models:** Bridge between user expectations and system reality  
3. **Interaction Models:** Detailed interface behaviors that support conceptual models

### Phase 2: Task Discovery Workshop (45-60 minutes)

#### Temporal Framework Setup
Choose appropriate time-based categorization:

**Option A - Daily Rhythm (Recommended for lifestyle/productivity apps):**
- Morning: Start-of-day activities and preparation
- Afternoon: Peak usage and active work periods  
- Evening: Wind-down and reflection activities
- Miscellaneous: Edge cases and unexpected scenarios

**Option B - Task Lifecycle (Recommended for specific workflows):**
- Before Taking Action: Preparation and planning phases
- While Performing: Active task execution 
- After Completion: Follow-up and reflection
- Miscellaneous: Supporting or peripheral activities

#### Tasks Board Population (20 minutes)
**Facilitation Questions:**
- "What specific things do users do during [time period] related to [domain]?"
- "Walk me through a typical [morning/afternoon/evening] for someone using this type of system"
- "What tasks might seem routine but actually require significant effort?"
- "What activities do users do that they might not even think of as 'tasks'?"

**Capture Guidelines:**
- One task per sticky note using active verbs
- Focus on user goals rather than system features
- Include emotional/mental tasks (e.g., "build confidence," "reduce anxiety")
- Probe for specificity: "Check email" → "Scan for urgent items requiring immediate response"

#### Gaps Board Population (25 minutes)
**Facilitation Questions:**
- "What challenges do users face during [time period] when trying to accomplish these tasks?"
- "What isn't working well in current solutions?"
- "Where do users get frustrated or confused?"
- "What takes more time/effort than users expect?"
- "What do users have to remember or figure out on their own?"

**Types of Gaps to Identify:**
- **Cognitive Load:** Too complex, requires too much memory
- **Time/Efficiency:** Takes longer than expected or needed
- **Emotional:** Creates frustration, anxiety, or confusion
- **Information:** Lack of clarity about status, next steps, or options
- **Integration:** Disconnected from other tools or workflows

#### Opportunities Board Population (15 minutes)
**Facilitation Questions:**
- "If you could wave a magic wand, how would you solve the challenges we just identified?"
- "What would an ideal solution look like for [specific gap]?"
- "How might we help users accomplish [task] more effectively?"
- "What capabilities would eliminate the most friction?"

**Opportunity Categories:**
- **Automation:** System handles routine tasks
- **Intelligence:** Predictive or adaptive behaviors
- **Integration:** Seamless connections between tools
- **Guidance:** Clear direction and feedback
- **Personalization:** Adaptation to individual needs and preferences

### Phase 3: Analysis and Synthesis (30 minutes)

#### Cross-Board Pattern Analysis
**Process:**
1. **Temporal Analysis:** Look for patterns within each time period
2. **Cross-Temporal Analysis:** Identify tasks/gaps that span multiple periods
3. **Intensity Mapping:** Mark highest-impact gaps and most-desired opportunities
4. **Dependency Identification:** Find tasks that enable or block other tasks

#### Affinity Mapping for Relationships
**Grouping Criteria:**
- **Functional Themes:** Related to similar types of work or goals
- **Emotional Themes:** Common frustrations or satisfaction drivers
- **User Types:** Different personas or user segments
- **Technical Themes:** Similar underlying system requirements
- **Priority Clusters:** High-impact, low-effort opportunities

#### Mental Model Documentation
**Key Deliverables:**
- **Assumption Inventory:** What users expect vs. what system provides
- **Conceptual Model Gaps:** Where user mental models don't match system reality
- **Interaction Model Requirements:** What interface behaviors would support user expectations

## Advanced Techniques

### Stakeholder Interview Integration
**When User Access is Limited:**
- Interview customer support teams about common user questions
- Engage sales teams about user objections and desires
- Review support tickets and user feedback for mental model clues
- Use analytics to infer user expectations from behavior patterns

**Cross-Reference:** See `ux_research_without_users.md` for comprehensive proxy research methods

### Persona-Driven Mental Modeling
Run separate mental modeling sessions for different user types:
- Novice users: Focus on learning curve and initial assumptions
- Expert users: Emphasis on efficiency and advanced capabilities
- Occasional users: Attention to memory aids and simplified workflows

**Cross-Reference:** See `user_personas.md` for persona development methodology

### Journey Integration
Use mental modeling outputs to inform journey mapping:
- Tasks become journey touchpoints
- Gaps become pain points on journey map
- Opportunities become journey improvement areas

**Cross-Reference:** See `journey_mapping.md` for detailed journey mapping process

## Troubleshooting

### Common Workshop Challenges

**"Participants focus on features rather than tasks"**
- Redirect with: "Before we think about solutions, what is the user trying to accomplish?"
- Use user story format: "As a [user], I want to [accomplish goal] so that [benefit]"
- Ask: "What would users do if this technology didn't exist?"

**"Gaps are too technical or implementation-focused"**
- Reframe with: "How does this affect the user's experience or emotions?"
- Probe with: "What does the user feel when this happens?"
- Redirect to user impact: "What can't the user accomplish because of this?"

**"Opportunities become feature specifications"**
- Guide toward: "What outcome would solve this gap?" rather than "What feature would we build?"
- Use "How might we..." framing to maintain open-ended thinking
- Focus on user benefits rather than system capabilities

**"Limited user access affecting quality"**
- Leverage stakeholder knowledge as proxy for user insights
- Use analytics and support data to validate or challenge assumptions
- Plan follow-up validation with actual users when possible
- Document confidence levels for different insights

### Analysis Challenges

**"Too many tasks/gaps/opportunities to synthesize"**
- Use dot voting for prioritization during workshop
- Focus synthesis on highest-impact clusters first
- Create multiple views: by time period, by user type, by impact level
- Document everything but prioritize actionable patterns

**"Gaps and opportunities don't align clearly"**
- Review gaps for specificity - vague gaps lead to misaligned opportunities
- Check if opportunities address emotional gaps, not just functional ones
- Consider if some gaps require multiple coordinated opportunities
