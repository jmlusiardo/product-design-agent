## The 6-Step Prompt Formula

### Step 1: Task - Clearly Define Your End Goal

**Purpose:** Provide specific, actionable instructions using clear action verbs.

**Key Principles:**
- Start with action verbs: generate, write, analyze, create, summarize, design
- Be clear and concise to ensure the AI understands your requirement
- The better your instruction, the better the result

**Simple Task Examples:**
- "Generate a three-month diet plan for me"
- "Analyze the key takeaways from user feedback"
- "Create a mobile-first interface design"

**Complex Task Examples:**
- "Summarize the key takeaways from user feedback for my newsletter, focusing on areas for improvement. Then categorize all remaining feedback by order of priority"
- "Create a healthcare prototype for patient data management with appointment scheduling, telemedicine interface, and HIPAA compliance"

### Step 2: Context - Tailor Your Response

**Purpose:** Provide background information that helps the AI tailor its response to your specific situation.

**Key Questions to Address:**
- What is the user's background?
- What does success look like?
- What is the setting/environment?

**Context Framework:**
- **Background:** Personal/professional situation
- **Success criteria:** Desired outcomes and constraints
- **Setting:** Environment, limitations, available resources

**Example Context:**
"I'm a 250-pound male aiming to lose 20 pounds of fat in three months. I only have time to cook meals once a week on Sundays for 2 hours. Provide a three-month diet plan to help me meet my goals within these constraints."

### Step 3: Examples - Mimic Style, Structure, Tone

**Purpose:** Provide reference materials so the AI can understand your expectations and deliver consistent results.

**Why Examples Work:**
- Research shows including examples can significantly enhance output quality
- Helps AI understand desired format, style, and depth
- Provides concrete reference points rather than abstract descriptions

**How to Use Examples:**
- Include 2-3 examples when possible (better than just one)
- Use existing work samples, job descriptions, or style references
- Specify format: "Draft the job description using the format of this existing job description below: [paste example]"

### Step 4: Persona - Embody Specific Expertise

**Purpose:** Have the AI adopt a specific character or expertise level to provide more targeted, professional responses.

**Persona Applications:**
- **Professional expertise:** "You are a physical therapist specializing in athlete recovery"
- **Industry knowledge:** "You are a hiring manager at a Fortune 500 company"
- **Style mimicry:** "Respond as a professional chef and provide a meal plan for a vegan diet"

**Pro Tips:**
- You can specify famous individuals for style: "Rewrite this blog post in the style of Eminem"
- Match expertise level to complexity of task
- Use industry-specific knowledge when relevant

### Step 5: Format - Specify Output Structure

**Purpose:** Direct the output format to receive information in a digestible and useful structure.

**Common Format Options:**
- **Tables:** For organizing data with clear headers
- **Bullet points:** For lists and step-by-step processes
- **Email format:** For professional communication

- **Paragraphs:** For explanatory content
- **Markdown:** For structured documents

**Format Specifications:**
- "Output in a table with headers: original feedback, priority, and level of difficulty"
- "Provide as numbered list with brief explanations"
- "Format as JSON for easy export to spreadsheet"
- "Use markdown formatting with clear section headers"

### Step 6: Tone - Add Emotional Context

**Purpose:** Ensure content meets your informational needs and resonates with the intended audience's emotions and expectations.

**Tone Examples:**
- **Casual tone:** Friendly, conversational, approachable
- **Formal tone:** Professional, structured, authoritative
- **Enthusiastic:** Energetic, positive, motivating
- **Witty:** Clever, humorous, engaging
- **Pessimistic:** Cautious, realistic, conservative

**Tone Application:**
"Use a friendly, casual tone to explain these marketing strategies" versus "Use a formal tone of voice for this executive presentation"

## Best Practices for Prompt Creation

### Core Principles

1. **Be Specific:** Provide detailed information rather than vague requests
  - ✅ Do: "What are the different breeds of small dogs suitable for apartment living?"
  - ❌ Don't: "Tell me about dog breeds"

2. **State Your Intent:** Express the underlying goal or reason behind your question
  - ✅ Do: "I'm helping my son with his science homework, can you explain quantum physics in a simple way?"
  - ❌ Don't: "Explain quantum physics"

3. **Use Correct Spelling and Grammar:** Proper language helps avoid confusion
  - Use spell check to correct typos before submitting
  - Clear grammar ensures AI understands your prompt correctly

4. **Direct the Output Format:** Specify whether you want steps, paragraphs, lists, etc.
  - ✅ Do: "Could you list the steps to make a chocolate cake?"
  - ❌ Don't: "How do you make a chocolate cake?" (without format specification)

### Advanced Techniques

5. **Limit Response Length:** Control output length for more focused replies
  - "Provide a brief summary in 3 bullet points"
  - "Keep response under 200 words"

6. **Specify Desired Aspects:** Focus on particular elements of the solution
  - "Focus on cost-effective solutions"
  - "Emphasize accessibility considerations"

7. **Use Delimitation Symbols:** Clearly specify text for AI to process
  - Use quotes, brackets, or other symbols: «{text you want to add}»
  - Helps AI understand exactly what content to work with

8. **Split Complex Tasks:** Break complicated requests into multiple specific tasks
  - Each task should be very specific and ordered
  - Consider using AI agents or sequential prompts for complex workflows

9. **Provide Context While Staying Concise:** Balance detail with brevity
  - Include relevant background without overwhelming
  - Focus on information that directly impacts the desired output

### Quality Assurance

10. **Fact-Check AI Responses:** Validate accuracy of AI-generated content
   - Ask AI to fact-check statements or provide sources
   - Cross-reference with authoritative sources
   - Be aware of potential hallucinations

11. **Follow Up with Questions:** Clarify or expand on initial responses
   - ✅ Do: Ask follow-up questions for clarification or additional detail
   - ❌ Don't: Assume a single prompt will always yield complete information

12. **Experiment with Different Phrasing:** Try alternative approaches if unsatisfied
   - Rephrase questions using different terminology
   - Approach the problem from different angles
   - Don't stick to the same phrasing expecting different results
