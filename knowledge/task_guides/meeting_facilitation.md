# Facilitator’s Playbook: Flipped & Async-First Meetings

> **Executive Summary** — A practical, step-by-step playbook for **facilitating** fewer, better meetings. Use an **async-first** approach and the **flipped meeting** model: push context and updates to pre-reads; use live time for higher-order collaboration; document outcomes and actions. Includes checklists, time-boxed run sheets, and reusable templates.

## Overview & Objectives
- **Purpose:** Help facilitators run effective meetings that prioritize meaningful interaction, decisions, and documentation.
- **Principles (from sources):**
  - Reserve meetings for **higher-level collaboration & connection**; move “information sharing” async.
  - **Fewer meetings** first; then improve the ones you keep.
  - **Prepared participants** via threads/docs/videos before the session.
  - **No obligation** to attend if active participation isn’t needed.
  - **Limit size:** fewer than **8** attendees; **5 or fewer** is even better.
  - **Always document outcomes** for those not present.
- **Success Criteria:** Clear purpose, focused agenda, visible roles, parked off-topics, explicit decisions, owners, and deadlines; post a concise summary within 24 hours.

## Meeting Purposes (Pick One)
- Problem-solving & brainstorming
- Strategic thinking & planning
- Decisions & alignment
- Planning & traction
- 1:1 relationships  
**Rule:** Don’t mix purposes in one session.

## Preparation (Facilitator Checklists)
### A) Before You Invite
- - [ ] Write a **clear agenda** tied to a single purpose
- - [ ] State the **desired outcome** (decision/options/risks)
- - [ ] Prepare a **pre-read** (thread/doc/video) for context
- - [ ] **Invite only** those you **need**
- - [ ] Pre-align with key people **1:1** to surface risks & contributions  
  *Goal: no surprises in the meeting.*

### B) Async Pre-work (Flip the Meeting)
- - [ ] Post context in a **thread/doc/whiteboard** with links & prior decisions
- - [ ] Ask participants to **comment async** on questions & options
- - [ ] Capture clarifications up front; cancel the meeting if alignment is reached
- - [ ] Confirm **roles** (facilitator, decision-maker, contributors, note-taker)

### C) Day-Of Setup
- - [ ] Confirm attendees; **arrive early** to set up tech/materials
- - [ ] Prepare **visuals** (boards, slides, stickies)
- - [ ] Create a visible **Parking Lot** for off-topic items
- - [ ] Decide how you’ll **score the meeting (1–10)** at the end

## Facilitation Run Sheet (Time-Boxed)
### 1) Opening (0–5 min)
- Start **on time**; ask for **no phones/laptops** unless presenting
- Reaffirm **purpose & agenda**; name roles/contributions
- Use a brief **hook** (story/metric/user clip) to focus attention

### 2) Core Work (15–45+ min)
- **Stick to the agenda**; steer toward the outcome
- Use **visuals/whiteboards**; keep people in their roles and constructive
- **Politely park** off-topic items into the Parking Lot
- Participation norm: **Not everyone must speak; everyone must feel heard**

### 3) Decision & Commit (5–10 min)
- Recap options & rationale; confirm **decision/owner/deadline**
- Identify dependencies/risks to track async

### 4) Close (3–5 min)
- Review agenda → **what we decided**
- **Next steps**: who does what by when
- Quick **pulse**: ask attendees to **score 1–10**
- Thank participants and **end on time**

## After the Meeting (24-Hour Window)
- Post the **shortest possible summary** in the same thread/doc:
  - Who attended
  - What was decided (and why)
  - Who does what, by when
- Attach **recording/notes**; resolve Parking Lot items
- Follow up **1:1** if needed; link the thread in related workspaces

## Templates / Canvases
### 1) Flipped Agenda (copy/paste)
- Purpose (pick one): …
- Desired outcome: …
- Pre-work (required reads/videos/comments): …
- Participants (≤8) & roles: …
- Run of show:
    - Opening (5): purpose, roles, hook
	- Discussion Blocks (n×10–15): topic → options → notes
	- Decision & Commit (10): owner, deadline, risks
	- Close (5): recap, actions, pulse 1–10
- Parking Lot: [item → owner → async follow-up]

### 2) Async Decision Brief (pre-read)
- Context & links:
- Problem/Goal (1 line):
- Options considered (pros/cons, data):
- Proposed decision (owner, target date):
- Open questions for the group:
- Stakeholders (required vs FYI):

### 3) Outcome & Action Log (post)
- Top priorities this month:
- Last week did:
- This week focus:
- Learning & growth:
- Well-being (R/Y/G):

### 5) Meeting Effectiveness Pulse
- On a scale of 1–10, how effective was this meeting for you?
- What made it effective?
- What would make it a 10 next time?

## Best Practices & Pitfalls
- **Do**
  - Treat meetings as the **exception**; default to threads/docs/videos
  - Keep **attendance small**; empower optional attendance for non-contributors
  - Require **preparation**; cancel if context isn’t reviewed
  - Use a **Parking Lot**; document decisions & actions in the same place as the pre-read
- **Avoid**
  - **“Update” meetings** (send an email/thread instead)
  - Mixing multiple purposes in one session
  - Inviting spectators who can **read the summary later**
  - Replacing meetings with chaotic chat—use structured, linkable threads/docs

## Tools & Resources (as mentioned in sources)
- **Threads/context:** Twist  
- **Docs:** Almanac  
- **Video context & answers:** Loom; Pitch (presentation recordings)  
- **Recording & annotation:** tl;dv  
- **Visual collaboration:** whiteboards/stickies (any tool your team uses)

## FAQ / Quick Answers
- **How many people should I invite?** Keep it **< 8**; **≤ 5** is better for candid participation.  
- **What if pre-reads aren’t done?** Hold participants accountable; reschedule or shorten scope rather than run an uninformed session.  
- **How do we replace recurring “info” meetings?** Use company-wide threads, async Q&As, and weekly snippets; keep social connection in optional check-ins.  
- **Isn’t fewer meetings always better?** Reducing meetings is a **means**, not the goal. Aim for a balance that preserves deep work **and** effective collaboration.
