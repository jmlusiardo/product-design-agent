# Creating and Running Usability Tests

> **Executive Summary** — This guide explains how to design and run remote usability tests for digital products. It covers planning, recruiting, task design, facilitation, and the use of pre- and post-test questionnaires. Reporting of test results is handled separately in `reporting_test_results.md`.

## Overview
- **Purpose:** Identify usability issues, validate design decisions, and gather user feedback through remote usability testing.
- **Scope:** Covers formative and summative remote usability tests (no in-person tests).
- **Audience:** UX researchers, product managers, designers, and developers.
- **Success Criteria:** Tests produce actionable insights, highlight usability problems, and inform design improvements.

## Preparation
### Key Considerations
- Define focus areas and goals (e.g., user expectations, business decisions).
- Select test type:
  - **Formative:** early, lo-fi prototypes, small sample.
  - **Summative:** later, hi-fi prototypes, larger sample.
- Choose user segments and number of participants (3–5 per segment recommended).
- Identify test tasks and end states (success criteria).
- Select remote usability testing tools (e.g., UserTesting, Loop11).

### Checklist
- [ ] Define test objectives and hypotheses.
- [ ] Select participant segments and screening criteria.
- [ ] Decide on number of participants (8–15 formative; 20–50 summative).
- [ ] Write test scenarios (10–15 tasks recommended).
- [ ] Prepare pre-test and post-test questionnaires.
- [ ] Assemble test assets (prototypes, accounts, task sheets).
- [ ] Conduct a dry run to ensure tasks are feasible and technology works.

## Main Flow / Process
### 1) Test Plan Creation
- Document objectives, tasks, scenarios, end states, and required equipment [oai_citation:0‡Preparing-For-a-Usability-Test.pdf](file-service://file-HUtUDe9L1Wk6685SxTR1p7).
- Prioritize critical tasks; run from easy → difficult.
- Estimate session length (60–90 minutes; max 120).
- Example: SkyTeam usability test plan included finding lounges, booking flights, and testing service features [oai_citation:1‡SkyTeam-Usability-Test-Plan.pdf](file-service://file-QrUrhmUqeuGr4drSh6AhKJ).

### 2) Recruiting Participants
- Screen based on psychographics (e.g., travel habits, device familiarity).
- Use professional recruiters if needed.
- Incentivize participants appropriately.

### 3) Pre-Test Phase
- Administer **Pre-Test Questionnaire** to capture demographics, experience level, and familiarity with product [oai_citation:2‡Pre-Test-Questionnaire-SkyTeam (1).pdf](file-service://file-3a13Aq7k3tqRbzMoR8j1Hp).
- Introduce participants:
  - Thank them.
  - Clarify that the test evaluates the product, not them.
  - Encourage think-aloud protocol.

### 4) Running the Test
- Facilitate remotely using chosen platform.
- Present one task at a time; avoid leading participants.
- Use neutral prompts (“What do you expect this to do?”).
- Collect both **qualitative observations** (frustrations, body language, satisfaction) and **quantitative metrics** (task success rate, time on task, error counts) [oai_citation:3‡dc72a202-e429-4e70-88b3-167976c26dd9_Usability_Testing.pdf](file-service://file-M91U5ZiDgrmnJ2vqjwPHte).
- Note patterns and pain points.

### 5) Post-Test Phase
- Administer **Post-Test Questionnaire** to capture subjective satisfaction, perceived difficulty, and feature evaluations [oai_citation:4‡Post-Test-Questionnaire-SkyTeam (1).pdf](file-service://file-1CsBuGrSdaHhaaWP8MEVxn).
- Example questions:
  - “What one thing would you change about the product?”
  - “What one thing should remain the same?”
  - Likert-scale ratings on ease, clarity, and value.

### 6) Wrap-Up
- Thank participants again.
- Inform them about next steps (if follow-up is needed).
- Ensure data is stored securely.

## Templates / Canvases
- **Test Plan Template:** Objectives, tasks, end states, equipment.
- **Pre-Test Questionnaire Example:** SkyTeam survey on familiarity, usage, and device preferences.
- **Post-Test Questionnaire Example:** SkyTeam survey on perceived value, task ease, and satisfaction.
- **Task Script Examples:** Scenario-driven tasks (e.g., “Find out if there is a SkyTeam lounge in San Francisco”).

## Aftermath / Follow-Ups
- Analyze data and extract insights (see task_guide: `reporting_test_results.md`).
- Debrief stakeholders with quick findings before full report.
- Archive test scripts, recordings, and participant notes for future reference.
- Plan recurring usability testing sessions to maintain continuous feedback.

## Best Practices & Pitfalls
### Do
- Run pilot tests before live sessions.
- Mix qualitative and quantitative data.
- Encourage participants to think aloud.
- Keep facilitation neutral.
- Involve stakeholders in observing sessions.

### Avoid
- Leading questions or coaching participants.
- Overloading tests with too many tasks.
- Ignoring participant demographics and context.
- Assuming first impressions represent the whole user base.
