# User Recruitment & Screening Playbook: Complete Guide to Finding and Qualifying Research Participants

> **Executive Summary** — This comprehensive guide provides practical frameworks for recruiting, screening, and managing research participants across different study types. It covers recruitment strategies, screening methodologies, participant management, and includes templates for various research contexts. Master the art of finding the right users who will provide meaningful insights for your research objectives.

## Overview & Objectives

- **Purpose:** Enable researchers to systematically recruit qualified participants who provide relevant insights for product and UX research
- **Scope:** Covers recruitment planning, screening design, participant sourcing, qualification processes, and session coordination
- **Audience:** UX researchers, product managers, designers, and teams conducting user studies
- **Success Criteria:**
 - Recruit participants who match target user profiles and research requirements
 - Minimize no-shows and unqualified participants through effective screening
 - Build sustainable recruitment processes for ongoing research needs
 - Maintain participant databases for future studies

## Prerequisites & Assumptions

- **Research objectives defined:** Clear understanding of what insights you need
- **Target audience identified:** User segments, personas, or behavioral characteristics established
- **Study methodology chosen:** Testing type determines recruitment approach (see `evaluation_type.md` and `usability_testing.md`)
- **Budget allocated:** Participant incentives and potential recruiter costs planned
- **Timeline established:** Adequate time for recruitment and scheduling (typically 1-2 weeks minimum)

## Recruitment Strategy Framework

### 1) Criteria Development

**Balance Act Principle:** Deciding on the right number and type of criteria is a balancing act. While reviewing proto-personas, ask these questions:

- **Relevance Check:** Does the criteria recruit participants who will provide relevant insights for the project?
- **Scope Decision:** Do I need only primary users? Or should I cover other specific segments?

**Key Considerations:**
- Screen for psychographics (app familiarity, Android/iOS usage, shopping frequency)
- Focus on behavioral attributes over demographics when possible
- Consider creating small, focused segments rather than broad groups

### 2) Participant Numbers by Study Type

**Standard Guidelines:**
- **Agile UX / Weekly Testing:** 3-5 users per segment
- **Formative Tests:** 8-15 participants may be appropriate
- **Summative Tests:** 20-50+ users recommended
- **Expert Reviews:** Fewer participants needed due to specialized knowledge

**Mix Requirements:**
- Ensure diverse user types within each segment
- Include both extreme users (edge cases) and mainstream users (majority representation)
- Always recruit 10-20% more participants than needed to cover no-shows

### 3) Participant Sourcing Strategies

**Professional Recruitment:**
- Contract professional recruiters ($120-$175 per positive recruit)
- Necessary for specialized users or hard-to-reach segments
- Provides access to pre-screened participant pools

**Alternative Sourcing Methods:**
- Interest groups and internet forums for niche audiences
- Customer databases and existing user lists
- Social media communities and professional networks
- Employee networks and referrals (with caution about bias)
- Intercept recruitment at relevant locations

**Hard-to-Reach Groups:**
- Leverage specialized recruiting agencies
- Partner with relevant organizations or associations
- Use snowball sampling from initial qualified participants
- Offer higher incentives for rare participant types

## Screening Design & Implementation

### Screening Questionnaire Structure

**Standard Flow:**
1. **Introduction & Purpose**
  - Researcher identification
  - Study description (general terms)
  - Time commitment and compensation

2. **Interest Validation**
  - Willingness to participate
  - Basic availability confirmation

3. **Vetting Questions**
  - Demographic qualifiers
  - Behavioral patterns
  - Experience levels
  - Technology usage

4. **Disqualification Criteria**
  - Industry conflicts
  - Recent research participation
  - Professional bias factors

5. **Confirmation & Logistics**
  - Recording consent
  - Contact information
  - Scheduling preferences

### Screening Question Design

**Effective Techniques:**
- Use behavioral indicators over self-reported preferences
- Include validation questions to verify responses
- Design questions that eliminate professional bias
- Create clear pass/fail criteria for each question

**Example Screening Criteria:**

**Technology Experience Validation:**
Please indicate which online activities you've done in the last 30 days:
□ Online banking or bill paying
□ Shopping online
□ Email or instant messaging
□ Web searches for information
□ Social media browsing
□ None of the above*
*If "none of the above" or only "gaming" selected: Not eligible

**Audience Segmentation:**
Would you describe yourself as: (Select all that apply)
□ Audience 1 criteria
□ Audience 2 criteria
□ Audience 3 criteria
Target: Mix across categories; all "no" = not eligible

## Participant Management Process

### Pre-Session Coordination

**Confirmation Workflow:**
1. **Initial Screening:** Complete qualification questionnaire
2. **Eligibility Notification:** Inform of selection status
3. **Session Scheduling:** Coordinate time/location preferences
4. **Confirmation Package:** Send details, directions, requirements
5. **Reminder Communication:** 24-48 hours before session

**Required Information Collection:**
- Contact details (phone, email)
- Emergency contact information
- Accessibility needs or accommodations
- Technology requirements (for remote sessions)
- Photo ID requirement notification

### Session Logistics

**Location Coordination:**
- Clear directions to testing facility
- Contact person information for arrival
- Security/lobby procedures
- Parking or transportation guidance

**Remote Session Setup:**
- Technology testing prior to session
- Backup communication methods
- Screen sharing and recording permissions
- Environment requirements (quiet space, stable internet)

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Photo ID verification
- Compensation acknowledgment
- Data usage agreements

## Quality Assurance & Bias Prevention
