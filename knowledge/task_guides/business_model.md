# Business Model Canvas Playbook: Design, Facilitate & Iterate

> **Executive Summary** — This guide explains how to design, discuss, and iterate a Business Model Canvas (BMC), and how to facilitate a hands-on workshop that produces a clear, testable business model. It covers the nine building blocks, prep materials, a time‑boxed agenda, templates, and follow‑ups. For deep work on value propositions, see **value_proposition.md**.

## Overview & Objectives
- **Purpose:** Create a shared, visual language to describe how a business creates, delivers, and captures value; align teams; and iterate to product/market fit.
- **Scope:** BMC definition, 9 building blocks, desirability/viability/feasibility framing, adaptability forces, workshop process, templates, and follow‑ups.
- **Audience:** Founders, intrapreneurs, product leaders, strategists, and workshop facilitators.
- **Outcomes:**
  - A clear, coherent BMC for a venture or line of business.
  - A prioritized set of assumptions to test next.
  - Alignment on customers, offering, and execution.
- **Core Benefits (of the BMC):**
  - Establishes a **shared language** for strategy discussions.
  - Enables **visual thinking** and rapid iteration on a single page.
  - Aligns activities and reveals **trade‑offs** across blocks.
  - Becomes a **living document** for continuous adaptation.

## The Business Model Canvas at a Glance
- **Nine Blocks (with guiding questions):**
  1. **Customer Segments** — Who are we creating value for? Who are our most important customers? Single or multi‑sided?
  2. **Value Propositions** — Why do customers choose us? Which problems/jobs do we solve? *(Defer deep methods to value_proposition.md)*
  3. **Channels** — How do we reach, sell to, and deliver value to customers? What’s working?
  4. **Customer Relationships** — What types of relationships (acquire/retain/grow)? How do they evolve along the journey?
  5. **Revenue Streams** — How do we earn revenue from each segment (one‑time vs. recurring)? Pricing approach?
  6. **Key Activities** — What critical things must we do to deliver the proposition?
  7. **Key Resources** — What strategic assets are required (physical, intellectual, human, financial)?
  8. **Key Partnerships** — What do we externalize to optimize, reduce risk, or access capabilities?
  9. **Cost Structure** — Major cost drivers; how tied to activities/resources and revenue.
- **Three Lenses for Fit:**
  - **Desirability** — Do customers want it? (Segments, Value Propositions, Channels, Relationships)
  - **Viability** — Is it worth it? (Revenue Streams, Cost Structure)
  - **Feasibility** — Can we deliver? (Key Resources, Key Activities, Key Partnerships)
- **Adaptability Forces to Monitor:**
  - **Industry & Market Forces, Key Trends, Macroeconomic Forces** — Track shifts that may require BMC changes.

## Preparation
### Roles & Inputs
- **Facilitator:** Guides flow, timeboxes, and synthesis.
- **Core Team:** Product/strategy lead, marketing/sales, ops/finance, tech lead; include frontline perspectives.
- **Inputs:** Existing research, metrics, competitor scans, prior canvases, customer feedback.

### Materials Checklist
- - [ ] Printed **Business Model Canvas** (A3/A2) or large whiteboard with BMC layout
- - [ ] Sticky notes (multiple colors), sharpies/pens, colored pencils
- - [ ] **Storyboarding squares** for channel/relationship exercises
- - [ ] Timer (for strict timeboxing)
- - [ ] Camera or scan app to capture outputs
- - [ ] Digital template link (for post‑workshop documentation)

### Minimum Viable Prep (Facilitator)
- - [ ] Review BMC basics and this agenda
- - [ ] Prepare printed canvases (2 per participant/team)
- - [ ] Print/cut **storyboarding squares** (≈3 per scene type per participant)
- - [ ] Curate any existing personas/problem statements
- - [ ] Set up room (stations for teams; visible canvas; supplies per table)

### Ground Rules
- **Bias for clarity:** short, legible notes; one idea per sticky.
- **Evidence beats opinion:** mark assumptions vs. validated facts.
- **Iterate in public:** keep drafts visible; version by date.
- **Time discipline:** stop on time; capture open items in a parking lot.

## Main Flow / Process (Workshop)
> **Total runtime:** ~2 hours (can scale to 3–4 hours with more discussion/testing prep)

### 1) Intro & Framing (5–10 min)
- Set objectives, outcomes, and review the BMC structure.
- Emphasize **Customer Segments ↔ Value Propositions** as the primary driver of the model.

### 2) Customers & Problems (Personas) (15–20 min)
- Individually list personas for your venture/product (buyers/users).
- Mark each as **B** (buyer), **U** (user), or both.
- For each persona: list **problems/jobs**, **current alternatives**.
- **Output:** Prioritized personas; top problem/need statements.

### 3) Value Propositions (10–15 min)
- Brainstorm propositions mapped to prioritized problems/jobs.
- **Rank** and **reduce** to the essentials.
- **Output:** Ranked list of value propositions.
- **Note:** For deeper methods (jobs, pains/gains, tests), see **value_proposition.md**.

### 4) Map to the Canvas (5–10 min)
- Place **Customer Segments** and **Value Propositions**; draw linkages.
- Draft a concise **positioning statement** to anchor peer presentations.

### 5) Channels & Relationships via AIDA(OR) Storyboards (25–30 min)
- Teach AIDA(OR) briefly (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action, Onboarding, Retention).
- Teams storyboard the journey; derive **Channels** and **Customer Relationships**.
- **Peer share‑outs** to refine clarity and assumptions.

### 6) Revenue Streams (10–15 min)
- Enumerate revenue mechanisms per segment/VP (transactional vs. recurring).
- Map revenue to existing segment↔VP links; note pricing hypotheses.

### 7) Infrastructure & Costs (20–25 min)
- **Key Activities** — What must be done (e.g., dev, supply chain, problem‑solving)?
- **Key Resources** — Assets required (e.g., IP, talent, capital).
- **Key Partnerships** — What to externalize (optimize, reduce risk, access capability).
- **Cost Structure** — Fixed/variable drivers; link to activities/resources and revenue.

### 8) Synthesis & Risks (10–15 min)
- Review the whole canvas for **coherence** and **trade‑offs**.
- Tag top **assumptions to test** (desirability/viability/feasibility).
- Capture external **adaptability forces** to watch.

### 9) Peer Presentations & Feedback (10–15 min)
- 4–5 minutes per team: present **context**, **canvas highlights**, **top assumptions**.
- Collect clarifying questions and test ideas, not wordsmithing.

### 10) Next Steps (5–10 min)
- Convert top assumptions into **test plans** (who/what/when).
- Assign owners and deadlines; schedule follow‑up.

## Templates / Canvases / Frameworks
- **Business Model Canvas (printable):** Use a large poster or whiteboard layout with the nine blocks.
- **Digital Templates:** Use a slide‑based template (Google Slides/PowerPoint) for documentation and distribution post‑workshop.
- **Storyboarding (AIDA[OR]):** Use storyboard squares to visualize the customer journey and derive **Channels** & **Relationships**.
- **Examples:** Consider reviewing worked examples for **startup** (e.g., small team seeking PMF) and **enterprise** (e.g., “digital transformation” team) contexts to calibrate fidelity and scope.

## Aftermath / Follow-ups
- **Document & Distribute**
  - - [ ] Capture photos of canvases; file in a shared workspace.
  - - [ ] Transcribe into the digital template; version by date.
  - - [ ] Write a one‑page **model brief** (purpose, scope, owners, next tests).
- **Testing Plan**
  - - [ ] Top 3 assumptions with **test cards** (method, metric, success criteria).
  - - [ ] Calendar invites for interviews/experiments.
- **Governance & Cadence**
  - - [ ] Weekly stand‑up: assumption status, learnings, pivots.
  - - [ ] Monthly **model review**: update canvas; decide persevere/pivot/park.
- **Dependencies**
  - - [ ] Partner outreach (if partnerships are critical).
  - - [ ] Resource requests (key hires, budget).
  - - [ ] Data/analytics needed to track viability metrics.

## Best Practices & Pitfalls
### Do
- **Start on paper first;** keep it messy and fast. Digitize later.
- **Prioritize segments/VPs;** avoid overstuffing the canvas.
- **Make assumptions explicit;** tag with “H” (hypothesis) vs. “V” (validated).
- **Link costs to activities/resources** and **revenues to segment/VP** links.
- **Revisit with new evidence;** the canvas is a living artifact.

### Avoid
- **Over‑detailing the left side** (infrastructure) before **desirability** is evidenced.
- **Treating the BMC as a static business plan.**
- **Confusing personas with segments;** personas help detail the segment.
- **Mixing multiple ventures** in one canvas; use one per business model.

## Tools & Resources
- **Printable BMC & Digital Templates:** Large poster/whiteboard layout; slide templates for post‑workshop documentation.
- **Storyboarding Squares (AIDA[OR]):** Paper squares to storyboard journeys; derive channels/relationships.
- **Workshop Slides & Agenda:** Use a structured agenda with exercises for personas, problem scenarios, storyboards, and block‑by‑block fill.
- **Strategy & Learning Stack:** Pair BMC with downstream artifacts (e.g., product charters, OKRs) once your model focus is clearer.
- **Companion Guide:** For value proposition detail and tests, see **value_proposition.md**.

## Common Business Model Types

Understanding prevalent **business model archetypes** helps teams position their venture, spot strategic analogies, and identify innovation paths. Use these archetypes to spark discussion when filling in your Business Model Canvas.

### Core Archetypes
- **B2B, B2C, C2C, C2B** — Traditional categories based on who buys and who sells.  
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)** — Subscription-based delivery of software online.  
- **Subscription** — Recurring revenue from ongoing access or replenishment.  
- **Platform / Aggregator** — Multi-sided markets enabling interactions between user groups; thrives on network effects.  
- **Freemium** — Free basic offering with paid premium upgrades.  
- **Product** — Physical or digital goods for one-time sale.  
- **Service** — Charging per engagement or outcome.  
- **Shared Assets** — Many users share access to a resource (e.g., co-working, ride sharing).  
- **Lease/Rental** — Temporary access to assets instead of ownership.  
- **Insurance** — Risk pooling with periodic premiums.  
- **Reselling / Retail** — Selling goods produced by others.  
- **Manufacturer / Production** — Producing and distributing goods.  
- **Fee-for-Service** — Pay per service performed.  
- **Bundling** — Grouping offerings together at a combined price.

### Workshop Activity
- Have teams identify 1–2 archetypes that resemble their business idea.  
- Reflect in the Canvas:
  - How do **Revenue Streams**, **Customer Relationships**, and **Channels** change under a Subscription vs. Platform vs. Freemium model?  
  - What **Key Resources** or **Key Activities** are critical for each archetype?  

## FAQ / Quick Answers
- **When should I use the BMC?** For focused discussions on what matters in a line of business, to align teams, and to surface/sequence assumptions to test.
- **Is BMC only for startups?** No. It’s powerful for **existing businesses** to clarify drivers and improve revenue/cost/profit levers; for early startups, focus the most on **customer–value fit** first.
- **How detailed should it be?** Start lean; keep only essentials that explain the model’s logic. Add detail as evidence accumulates.
- **How often do we update it?** Whenever material evidence changes—treat it as a living document.
- **What about the Value Proposition Canvas?** Use it when you need deeper work on jobs, pains/gains, and offer fit—see **value_proposition.md**.
