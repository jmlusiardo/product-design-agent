# Designing Customer–Value Fit: A Field Guide to the Value Proposition Canvas

> **Executive Summary** — The Value Proposition Canvas (VPC) helps teams describe and test how a product’s **value** matches a specific **customer segment’s** jobs, pains, and gains. It is a plug-in to the Business Model Canvas (BMC) and is used before, during, and after customer discovery to design and evaluate “fit.” It supports both new and existing value propositions and its aim is to achieve problem–solution (product/market) fit by aligning to customers’ **needs and jobs-to-be-done**.

## Overview

- **Purpose:** Map a value proposition to a target customer profile and evaluate fit between what you offer and what customers expect.  
- **Scope:** Use the VPC alongside your BMC (see `business_model.md` for the full model). The VPC focuses on **Customer Segment ↔ Value Proposition** alignment.  
- **Audience:** Product, UX, and service teams; the tool is widely used by businesses and designers.  
- **Success Criteria / KPIs:** Evidence that top customer pains/gains are addressed by your pain relievers/gain creators, validated by tests with real customers.  

## Preparation

- **Research & Planning**
  - Choose **one** customer segment and **one** value proposition per canvas.
  - Plan to **test assumptions** outside the building (interviews/experiments).
  - Bring team members with **deep customer knowledge** (frontline, support, sales).
  - Keep BMC context handy but out of scope (refer to `business_model.md`).

- **Materials & Setup**
  - Large printed canvas or whiteboard; use **sticky notes/Stattys** and markers.
  - Don’t write directly on the map; keep ideas on movable notes.
  - One idea per note (no bullets on a single sticky).
  - Color-code: e.g., yellow for Customer Jobs/Products & Services, orange for Pains, green for Gains/Pain Relievers/Gain Creators.
  - Combine visuals & words for faster comprehension.

- **Checklist**
  - - [ ] One canvas per segment–value pair selected.
  - - [ ] Team includes customer-facing members.
  - - [ ] Notes ready (one idea per note; color-coded).
  - - [ ] Plan for validation interviews/tests.
  - - [ ] Keep BMC nearby for context (see `business_model.md`).

## Main Flow / Process

### 1) Frame the Customer Segment
- Define the target **customer segment** for this canvas (one canvas per segment).
- **Questions to ask:**
  - Who exactly are we designing value for?
  - What context or situation are they in?
  - What jobs are they trying to get done?

---

### 2) Map the **Customer Profile**

#### a) Customer Jobs
- **Definition**: Tasks customers are trying to perform, problems they are trying to solve, or needs they are trying to satisfy. Jobs can be functional, social, or emotional.  
- **Guiding questions**:
  - What tasks are customers trying to complete?
  - What functional problems are they trying to solve?
  - What social goals are they trying to achieve (status, image, power)?
  - What emotional states are they trying to reach or avoid?
- **Examples**:
  - A homeowner wants to fix a leaky pipe quickly (functional job).
  - A student wants to look knowledgeable in front of peers (social job).
  - A fitness app user wants to feel more confident (emotional job).

#### b) Customer Pains
- **Definition**: Negative experiences, emotions, or risks that occur before, during, or after customers try to get a job done.  
- **Guiding questions**:
  - What makes the customer feel bad?
  - What obstacles prevent them from getting jobs done?
  - What are the main difficulties and challenges?
  - What are the negative social consequences?
  - What risks do they fear (financial, reputational, functional)?
- **Examples**:
  - A business traveler finds booking multiple flights stressful.
  - A user fears losing data if software crashes.
  - Waiting times and inefficiency cause frustration.

#### c) Customer Gains
- **Definition**: Benefits or outcomes the customer wants—both required and desired. Gains can be functional, social, or emotional.  
- **Guiding questions**:
  - What savings (time, money, effort) would customers value?
  - What outcomes do they expect and what would delight them?
  - What makes their life or job easier?
  - What positive social consequences do they desire?
- **Examples**:
  - A food delivery app gives meals in 15 minutes (speed).
  - A sustainable brand helps a customer feel ethical (social gain).
  - A product improves health and well-being (functional + emotional).

---

### 3) Prioritize
- After listing jobs, pains, and gains, **rank them by importance**.
- Not all jobs, pains, or gains matter equally—identify **critical ones** to focus on.
- Great value propositions excel at solving a **few big pains** or creating a **few strong gains**.

---

### 4) Map the **Value Proposition**

#### a) Products & Services
- **Definition**: What you offer to help the customer complete a job or solve a pain.  
- **Questions**:
  - What products/services do we provide?
  - Which customer jobs do they help with?
- **Examples**:
  - An app that tracks workouts.
  - A consulting service that reduces tax filing stress.

#### b) Pain Relievers
- **Definition**: How your product reduces or eliminates specific pains.  
- **Questions**:
  - How does our solution eliminate frustrations or obstacles?
  - Does it reduce risks or negative outcomes?
- **Examples**:
  - Automated reminders reduce missed payments.
  - Insurance reduces financial risks.

#### c) Gain Creators
- **Definition**: How your product delivers outcomes customers expect, desire, or would be surprised by.  
- **Questions**:
  - How does our solution create savings or added value?
  - How does it exceed expectations?
  - How does it make customers feel better or more successful?
- **Examples**:
  - Loyalty points make customers feel rewarded.
  - A design tool allows faster, more creative work.

---

### 5) Evaluate **Fit**
- Compare both sides of the canvas: Does what you offer **directly connect** with the most important jobs, pains, and gains?  
- Types of Fit:
  - **Problem–solution fit**: Evidence your products/services address jobs, pains, and gains.
  - **Product–market fit**: Customers validate your proposition with adoption and revenue.

---

### 6) Separate **Current vs. Future Ideas**
- Keep today’s realities apart from tomorrow’s concepts.  
- Use color coding or separate canvases to avoid confusion.  
- Example: Current pain = “long checkout lines.” Future solution = “AI-powered instant checkout.”

---

### 7) Design Experiments & Iterate
- The canvas represents **hypotheses**, not facts.  
- Test your assumptions through:
  - Customer interviews
  - Prototypes
  - A/B tests
  - Pilot launches
- **Key questions:**
  - Did customers confirm the job is important?
  - Did they validate the pain reliever or gain creator as valuable?
  - Did adoption or usage prove product–market fit?
- Remember: A polished canvas without evidence is only a hypothesis—testing provides proof.

## Templates / Canvases / Frameworks

- **Blank VPC Layout (text version)**
  - **Customer Profile**
    - *Jobs* — …
    - *Pains* — …
    - *Gains* — …

  - Include visuals + words on notes for clarity.
  - Keep each canvas scoped to **one** segment–value pair.
- **Printable Template**
  - Strategyzer-style “the-value-proposition-canvas-1.pdf”.

## Aftermath / Follow-ups

- **Synthesize Findings**
  - Update the canvas to reflect validated insights; archive superseded versions (separate current vs. future).
- **Validate Fit**
  - Run interviews/experiments to test your assumptions about pains/gains and your relievers/creators.
- **Feed Into BMC**
  - Propagate what you’ve learned to the Value Proposition and Customer Segment blocks in your BMC (see `business_model.md`).

## Best Practices & Pitfalls

- **Do**
  - Bring people with customer knowledge into the session.
  - Use movable notes; don’t write directly on the map.
  - Keep one idea per note; keep it scannable.
  - Combine visuals and words to speed understanding.
- **Avoid**
  - Trying to alleviate every pain and target every gain—focus.
  - Mixing present and future ideas on one map.
  - Sketching multiple segments/propositions on a single canvas.
  - Treating a good-looking canvas as proof—it’s untested without evidence.

## FAQ

- **When should I use the VPC—before or after research?**  
  Use it before, during, and after customer discovery to surface what you need to learn and to evaluate fit as you go.

- **Is the VPC only for new products?**  
  No. It works for new and existing value propositions and segments.

- **How is it different from the BMC?**  
  The VPC zooms into the **Value Proposition ↔ Customer Segment** relationship; for the full business model, see `business_model_canvas.md`.
