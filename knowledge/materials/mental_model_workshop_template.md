## Workshop Boards Template

### Tasks Board

**Instructions:** What specific things do users do during each time period related to [domain]?

| Morning | Afternoon | Evening | Miscellaneous |
|---------|-----------|---------|---------------|
| [Add tasks as separate items] | [Add tasks as separate items] | [Add tasks as separate items] | [Add tasks as separate items] |

**Facilitation Questions:**
- "Walk me through a typical [time period] for someone using this type of system"
- "What tasks might seem routine but actually require significant effort?"
- "What activities do users do that they might not even think of as 'tasks'?"

### Gaps Board

**Instructions:** What challenges do users face when trying to accomplish these tasks?

| Morning | Afternoon | Evening | Miscellaneous |
|---------|-----------|---------|---------------|
| [Add gaps as separate items] | [Add gaps as separate items] | [Add gaps as separate items] | [Add gaps as separate items] |

**Facilitation Questions:**
- "What isn't working well in current solutions?"
- "Where do users get frustrated or confused?"
- "What takes more time/effort than users expect?"
- "What do users have to remember or figure out on their own?"

### Opportunities Board

**Instructions:** How might we solve the challenges and improve the user experience?

| Morning | Afternoon | Evening | Miscellaneous |
|---------|-----------|---------|---------------|
| [Add opportunities as separate items] | [Add opportunities as separate items] | [Add opportunities as separate items] | [Add opportunities as separate items] |

**Facilitation Questions:**
- "If you could wave a magic wand, how would you solve these challenges?"
- "What would an ideal solution look like?"
- "How might we help users accomplish [task] more effectively?"

## Synthesis Framework

### Affinity Mapping Clusters
**Instructions:** Group related items and identify patterns

**Cluster 1:** [Theme Name]
- Tasks: [List related tasks]
- Gaps: [List related gaps]  
- Opportunities: [List related opportunities]
- Priority: [High/Medium/Low]

**Cluster 2:** [Theme Name]
- Tasks: [List related tasks]
- Gaps: [List related gaps]
- Opportunities: [List related opportunities]  
- Priority: [High/Medium/Low]

### Mental Model Documentation

**Key User Assumptions:**
- Users expect: [Assumption 1]
- Users assume: [Assumption 2]
- Users believe: [Assumption 3]

**Mental Model vs Reality Gaps:**
- Gap 1: Users think [X] but system does [Y]
- Gap 2: Users expect [X] but need to [Y]
- Gap 3: Users assume [X] but actually [Y]

**Design Implications:**
- Implication 1: [How this affects interface design]
- Implication 2: [How this affects feature prioritization]
- Implication 3: [How this affects user onboarding]

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
- [ ] Synthesize workshop outputs into summary document
- [ ] Share findings with design and product teams
- [ ] Identify highest-priority assumptions for validation
- [ ] Plan follow-up research if needed

### Validation Planning
- [ ] Which assumptions need user validation?
- [ ] What research methods will we use?
- [ ] When will validation occur?
- [ ] How will results inform design decisions?
