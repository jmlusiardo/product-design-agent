References
Arkes and Blumer from 1985 The Psychology of Sunk Cost, asked this question in a study: “You have spent $100 on a ticket for a weekend ski trip to Michigan. Several
weeks later you buy a $50 ticket for a weekend ski trip to Wisconsin.

You think you will enjoy the Wisconsin ski trip more than the Michigan ski
trip. Suddenly you realized your just-purchased Wisconsin ski trip is the
same weekend as the Michigan trip! It’s too late to sell either ticket, and you
cannot return either one. You must use one ticket and not the other. Which
ski trip will you go on?

$100 ski trip to Michigan OR $50 ski trip to Wisconsin?”


Almost all people answered the Wisconsin trip, since they where balancing about the enjoyment vs. the sunk cost of $50 for not choosing Michigan.
